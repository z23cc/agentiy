# Testing Agentry

Use this guide for contributor-facing test changes. Follow `AGENTS.md` for coordinated daemon use, style checks, and lifecycle approvals. Use `$rpce-test-quality` when deciding whether coverage is worth adding, retaining, consolidating, or removing.

The default executable suite is Rust unit tests (`cargo test --lib`). Swift XCTest trees were removed. Integration, process, and proptest suites stay in-tree behind `CARGO_TEST_KIND=full`. Hosted CI is a Linux secret scan. `preflight.sh` is whitespace, secrets, and guardrails; run `make dev-test` yourself.

## Quality gate before adding a test

Add a test only when all four answers are concrete:

1. **Contract:** What current behavior must remain true?
2. **Plausible defect:** What realistic regression would violate it, and what is the impact?
3. **Lowest faithful layer:** Can deterministic core or provider-package coverage reproduce the risk, or is root SwiftPM integration actually required?
4. **Observable oracle:** What exact output, state, error, side effect, cleanup, wire format, or bounded performance result distinguishes broken from correct behavior?

Search existing direct and outcome-level coverage first. Prefer a test that fails against known-bad behavior. Do not add invocation-only, no-crash, non-nil-only, source-shape, symbol-presence, constant-restatement, arbitrary-sleep, or coverage-driven tests unless that fact is itself the contract and no stronger oracle exists.

## Choose the lowest faithful layer

- **Isolated core:** deterministic decisions, transformations, parsers, state machines, policy, invariants, and failure semantics in `rust/crates/*/src` unit tests.
- **Crate integration:** proto/session-log/ffi fixture tests and runtime process/proptest suites under `rust/crates/*/tests`. Default `make dev-test` does not run these; use `CARGO_TEST_KIND=full`.
- **Runtime diagnostics:** assembled-app-only rendering, restoration, routing instrumentation, churn, or resource investigations. Require a bounded scenario, privacy-safe machine-readable evidence, entry point, and cleanup path.
- **Live/packaged smoke:** real app/MCP wiring, bundle layout, embedded helpers, ownership, signing, provenance, and a few critical journeys.
- **Structural guard:** last resort when executable behavior, compiler boundaries, lint, or guardrails cannot cheaply enforce a narrow constraint.

Do not use smoke as the only protection for deterministic logic. Without a predeclared acceptance threshold, a benchmark is diagnostics rather than executable contract coverage.

## Add and run Rust coverage

- **Unit tests:** `#[cfg(test)]` modules next to the code under `rust/crates/*/src`. Default `make dev-test` / `make dev-cargo-test` runs `--lib` only.
- **Integration tests:** `rust/crates/*/tests`. Keep process coexistence, proptest, and measurement harnesses here so the default loop stays cheap. Run with `make dev-test CARGO_TEST_KIND=full`.
- Keep one coherent contract per test. Labeled tables are appropriate when cases differ only by input, boundary, or expected outcome.

Focused daemon-coordinated examples:

```bash
make dev-test
make dev-test FILTER=workspace_persistence
make dev-cargo-test CARGO_PACKAGE=runtime
make dev-test CARGO_TEST_KIND=full
```

A focused green `--lib` run is evidence for unit contracts. Use `CARGO_TEST_KIND=full` when the change touches process supervision, inventory-scope concurrency, or proto/session-log fixture tests. Hosted CI does not run cargo tests.

## Codemap-sensitive changes

Routine pipeline and integration tests should not await real codemap generation when generation correctness is not the contract. Prefer seams, fakes, synthetic artifacts, or dual-path assertions that accept either pending/not-ready codemap status or ready code-structure output while still proving routing, path shape, and leakage boundaries.

Use the retained deterministic CodeMap tests for local coverage:

```bash
make dev-cargo-test CARGO_PACKAGE=runtime FILTER=codemap
make dev-test CARGO_TEST_KIND=full FILTER=codemap
```

Run these when changes touch CodeMap generation, syntax parsing, artifact storage, or Tree-sitter support. The packaged-app live codemap projection-demand gate is documented later in this guide.

Context Builder inactive-target coverage must stay within one `MCPDomainRuntime`. Windows are presentation scopes over that process-wide authority; a workspace created through one runtime cannot be appended to another window's manager as a supported handoff. Do not recreate that topology in a test with a side-channel authority client: it bypasses the runtime's routing registration and storage lease, and can only produce misleading failures. Add a runtime-level handoff contract before introducing cross-runtime coverage.

## Scale-sensitive contract gates

Scale and measurement harnesses live in `rust/crates/runtime/tests` and env-gated unit probes. They are not part of default `--lib`. Run them explicitly:

```bash
make dev-test CARGO_TEST_KIND=full FILTER=search_measurement
RP_RUN_TEXTDECODE_CUTOVER_BENCHMARK=1 make dev-cargo-test CARGO_PACKAGE=runtime FILTER=td4
```

## Performance and optimization evidence

Define the workload, acceptance threshold, comparable environment, sample count, warmup policy, source-state controls, invalid-sample rules, and retained evidence before measuring. Keep root and provider timings separate unless a derived serial estimate is clearly labeled. Diagnostic and wake-probe runs are lifecycle evidence, not valid timing samples.

Use focused before/after measurements to attribute a change, then exercise the full affected boundary before making repository-wide performance claims. Store durable evidence only when it has continuing review value; otherwise keep raw logs and machine-specific samples local. Do not create a replacement executable registry, method census, append-only repository scoreboard, or mandatory artifact hierarchy merely to track test counts.

## Live Codex Desktop direct-headless worktree routing

Run this release acceptance only from a Codex Desktop task whose repository root is an existing linked worktree and whose Agentry launcher selects `--backend headless` with that exact root in `AGENTRY_MCP_WORKING_DIRS`. The canonical checkout must already belong to one saved Agentry workspace. This lane validates an installed release candidate; it does not build, install, launch, stop, or relaunch RepoPrompt, create a workspace, or create a worktree.

Record the saved workspace file hash and `git worktree list --porcelain` before starting. In the same Codex task:

1. Call `bind_context` with `op=status`. Require a bound context from the saved canonical workspace, then use `get_file_tree`, `read_file`, and `git status` to prove the task's linked worktree is the physical execution root. A path that exists only in the canonical checkout must remain outside the root fence.
2. Start two detached `agent_run` sessions with `worktree=@current` and bounded read-only instructions that report a worktree-only marker. Save both returned session IDs and require them to be distinct.
3. Reconcile both exact session IDs with `agent_run op=wait` and inspect them with `agent_manage op=list_sessions`. Require both terminal snapshots to report the same exact `worktree_root_path`, repository identity, and worktree identity, and require both markers to come from that worktree. Cancel and reconcile any nonterminal session before ending the task. Nested `orchestrate` acceptance belongs to the separate direct-headless workflow/tool-policy change and is not a release gate for this standalone routing change.
4. Recheck `git worktree list --porcelain`, the saved workspace file hash, and workspace catalog count. Require no added worktree, no changed saved workspace, no temporary workspace, and no durable worktree binding. Repeat once with an explicit different existing selector and require only that session's physical root to change.

The Codex Desktop pre-start app-CLI isolation fallback remains in place through this acceptance and the release that contains the fix. Removing or bypassing it is a separate post-release change after the recorded acceptance passes; a failed or unavailable direct-headless check leaves the fallback unchanged.

## Live Agent Mode file-tool performance diagnostic

`Scripts/benchmark_agent_mode_file_tools.py` measures paired `file_search` and `read_file` calls from exactly two concurrent Explore sessions: the normal workspace root and a linked worktree. It requires an already-running Agentry DEBUG app and never launches, stops, or relaunches the app.

```bash
python3 Scripts/benchmark_agent_mode_file_tools.py \
  --window-id 1 \
  --marker debugDiagnosticsToolName \
  --path Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/Diagnostics/MCP/MCPConnectionManager+DebugDiagnostics.swift
```

By default the driver creates a detached temporary worktree and removes it only when it remains clean and both sessions are terminal; pass `--worktree /absolute/path` to use and preserve an existing linked worktree from the same Git common directory. The manifest records the benchmark worktree's SHA and dirty state. Each run writes a private (`0700`), non-overwriting directory under `/tmp/rpce-agent-file-tools/v1/`; use `--output-root` to override it. Artifacts include provenance, raw CLI calls and agent logs, capture/runtime snapshots, `samples.ndjson`, and `summary.json`, and may contain sensitive workspace snippets, so review them before sharing. Samples and exact workload counts/order come from DEBUG capture timelines (`Received` through the `event_completion` `MainActorExited`); start/wait binding metadata independently proves local-versus-worktree route provenance, while compacted agent logs validate only surfaced call arguments and the final response. Latency is report-only and has no arbitrary failure threshold. Harness, tool-count, nonempty-marker, read-success, and cleanup invariants are enforced.

Offline replay performs no CLI, model, or app calls and accepts either a checked-in fixture or a prior artifact directory:

```bash
python3 Scripts/benchmark_agent_mode_file_tools.py \
  --replay Scripts/Fixtures/agent-mode-file-tools/v1/paired-success
```

The checked-in success and negative fixtures are privacy-scrubbed subsets derived from real paired captures. They retain relevant event/stage timing shapes but contain no raw agent prose, user paths, UUIDs, or raw logs.

Pure harness validation:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile Scripts/benchmark_agent_mode_file_tools.py Scripts/test_agent_mode_file_tools_benchmark.py
python3 Scripts/test_agent_mode_file_tools_benchmark.py
```

## Live large-workspace worktree-startup diagnostic

`Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py` is the reusable validation lane for
large-root and linked-worktree startup. It drives `agentry-cli-debug` and the
DEBUG-only `worktree_startup_benchmark` diagnostics. It never builds, installs,
launches, stops, or relaunches RepoPrompt. A fresh-process (cold) run therefore
requires a separately approved relaunch before invoking the script; label a run
`cold` only when that boundary is true. An aged run requires the configured
minimum existing Agent Mode session count and keeps aged and warm samples in
separate distributions.

This is a runtime diagnostic, not XCTest coverage. It does not replace focused
behavioral tests or the broader suite validation required by the changed boundary.

### Interactive-readiness iteration 0 campaign

The worktree interactive-readiness campaign uses additive DEBUG diagnostic
schema 5. Production route behavior is unchanged. Its authoritative iteration-0
root is the real Agentry main checkout in the dedicated
`RPCE Search Bench Main 20260618` workspace (or a clearly owned equivalent real
clone), never the active development tab/workspace. Synthetic repositories are
allowed only by `self-test` and are labeled non-authoritative.

Each route/width/process series is predeclared as exactly one excluded warmup
plus five retained samples. Keep every valid slow sample and never replace an
ordinal. The primary value is the app-monotonic interval from
`bindingTransitionStarted` to the later successful direct `file_search` or
`read_file` completion. Search/read start concurrently. Report the five raw
values, p50, nearest-rank p95, and sample CV. CV above 50% requires a distinct
predeclared confirmation plan with another one-plus-five series; do not pool the
series, and accept a direction only when both agree.

Primary performance validity is intentionally separate from follow-on
acceptance. Immediately after concurrent direct search/read, the harness takes
a correlation-bound diagnostic checkpoint. `primary_performance` requires the
exact correlation/session/context/invocation/ordinal/build identity, ordered
root/search/read boundaries, both the recorded concurrent outcome with empty
mark failures and strict cross-operation interval overlap, successful structured direct probes with logical
canonical display plus exact physical `worktree_scope`, the frozen committed
path/blob markers, exactly one unambiguous correlation-bound receipt decision
at the consumption terminal stage with route-specific creation/coordinator/
projection/consumption semantics, the exact actual route, no
fallbacks, and final resource/cleanup proof. Codemap, passive tree, and
selection are stored under `follow_on_acceptance`. A follow-on failure remains
campaign-blocking and visible but does not discard a valid primary value.
Follow-on collection is total: timeout/malformed results are typed, every
configured operation records exact start/completion mark outcomes, a failed
start mark cannot be replaced by validator success, selection completes only
after its selection-get result is recorded, later follow-ons still run, and the
final diagnostic export is attempted once without retry or ordinal replacement.
Acceptance validates the exact typed operation and failure inventory plus the
collection-completed mark. `get_code_structure` keeps its internal 10-second
deadline; the harness supplies no model-controlled wait field.

Plan and preflight the real root with explicit ownership and dedicated-workspace
confirmation:

```bash
OWNER_TOKEN="$(uuidgen)"
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py create-marker \
  --root-path /Users/pvncher/Documents/Git/repoprompt-ce-release \
  --workspace-id '<workspace-uuid>' --root-id '<root-uuid>' \
  --owner-token "$OWNER_TOKEN" \
  --confirm-real-repository-benchmark --confirm-dedicated-workspace

python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py plan \
  --workspace-name 'RPCE Search Bench Main 20260618' \
  --window-id '<window-id>' --workspace-id '<workspace-uuid>' \
  --context-id '<context-uuid>' --root-id '<root-uuid>' \
  --root-path /Users/pvncher/Documents/Git/repoprompt-ce-release \
  --owner-token "$OWNER_TOKEN" --dataset-label rpce-real-readiness-iteration-0 \
  --asserted-file-count '<exact-git-ls-files-count>' --base-ref HEAD \
  --search-marker WorkspaceRootSeedPlanner \
  --read-path Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/WorkspaceContext/Search/WorkspaceRootSeedPlanner.swift \
  --read-marker 'import CryptoKit' --invocations-per-series 1 \
  --confirm-real-repository-benchmark --confirm-dedicated-workspace \
  --output /tmp/rpce-real-readiness-iteration-0.json

python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py preflight \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-real-readiness-iteration-0.json \
  --confirm-live-debug-app --confirm-dedicated-workspace
```

For an offline revalidation of an immutable forced-full one-plus-five artifact,
persist the exact artifact-file hashes, per-sample checkpoint and source-record
hashes, harness/validator source hash and version, exact command, sample
identities, and unchanged warmup/retained raw values:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py revalidate-primary \
  --plan '<frozen-primary-plan.json>' \
  --artifact '<forced-full-artifact-directory>' \
  --output '<primary-revalidation-provenance.json>'
```

This command is offline and accepts only an exact width-1 forced-full artifact
with one warmup and five retained ordinals. It fails closed on mixed identities,
changed raw values, missing hashes, invalid primary checkpoints, resource
failure, or incomplete cleanup; it does not rewrite the source artifact.

Run width 1 forced-full, then projected. Do not run widths 4/8 or aged until
width-1 projected has exactly `{"diffSeedServing":1}` and an empty fallback map:

```bash
for ROUTE in forced-full projected; do
  python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py run \
    --plan /tmp/rpce-real-readiness-iteration-0.json \
    --route "$ROUTE" --process-state warm --checkout-kind linked-worktree \
    --width 1 --invocation 1 --warmups 1 --samples 5 \
    --confirm-live-debug-app --confirm-process-state \
    --confirm-dedicated-workspace
done
```

Timing evidence comes from the correlation-bound primary checkpoint and direct
structured tool results, not inference wall time or assistant prose. Session-bound tools
must keep CE's logical canonical root display while `worktree_scope` proves the
exact physical binding by worktree ID; never require the displayed root path to
equal the app-managed worktree path. Schema-v5 samples require every readiness
boundary, monotonic phase order, duration consistency, attributed passive-tree
work, and configured marker-publication evidence. The small inference gate
separately checks exact raw tool-call/result order and forbidden-tool absence.
Retain root/search/read in `primary_performance`; retain first and warm codemap,
passive tree, selection, Git/filesystem/planner/lock, and marker evidence in
`follow_on_acceptance`; retain CPU/RSS/physical-footprint, cleanup, and
actual-route evidence for both validity decisions. Append iteration results to
`prompt-exports/optimize-worktree-interactive-readiness-runs.md`.

### Iteration 1 measurement-integrity remediation

Resource receipts publish absolute resident/physical-footprint values and their
deltas independently on a 0.1 MiB grid. Validation therefore accepts a displayed
arithmetic discrepancy of exactly 0.1 MiB and rejects 0.2 MiB; all fields must
remain finite and on that published grid. This tolerance does not weaken CPU,
availability, sample-count, peak-ordering, or other resource gates.

Every armed start is written to `state.json` before `agent_run.start`. Normal and
resumed cleanup use the same bounded state machine: status-free
`manage_worktree list`; exact correlation/control recovery and cooperative abort;
cancel or terminalize; unbind/release logical ownership; one session-specific
store-drain proof; physical cleanup; then a second status-free inventory and
final drain proof. Recovery never requests `include_status`. Missing, expired,
timed-out, nonzero, or ambiguous evidence sets `manual_cleanup` and preserves the
physical resource. The DEBUG recovery registry and drain snapshot are bounded
diagnostic records, not enterprise file-count limits; they return IDs, counts,
digests, phases, and actor-entry delay, never raw enterprise paths.

After a same-build projected one-plus-five artifact is valid, run one
non-aggregatable real Agent Mode gate:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py live-inference-gate \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-real-readiness-iteration-0.json \
  --projected-artifact '<valid-projected-artifact-directory>' \
  --confirm-live-debug-app --confirm-owned-resources
```

The gate fails unless the raw transcript contains exactly one ordered
`file_search` call/result pair followed by one `read_file` call/result pair, no
other tool, terminal `completed`, and the fixed sentinel. Spartan transcript
events prove invocation/order only. Exact same-context direct structured probes
must independently prove logical root, physical `worktree_scope`, worktree ID,
path, and content, with exact correlation/session/invocation/ordinal,
`{"diffSeedServing":1}`, and empty fallbacks. Assistant prose and inference wall
time are never evidence.

### Dedicated workspace and plan

Use a disposable workspace whose name starts with `RPCE 8E Bench ` or the
established `RPCE Search Bench ` prefix. Never use
the active development checkout: the driver rejects its own repository root.
Create/open a separate disposable root with `agentry-cli-debug`, bind the benchmark
tab, and record its exact window, workspace, context, and root IDs. A name or
current selection is not proof of isolation. Create an exclusive root marker
with a new owner UUID after those stable IDs exist:

```bash
OWNER_TOKEN="$(uuidgen)"
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py create-marker \
  --root-path /absolute/path/to/disposable/large/repository \
  --workspace-id '<workspace-uuid>' \
  --root-id '<root-uuid>' \
  --owner-token "$OWNER_TOKEN" \
  --confirm-disposable-root
```

The marker binds its canonical root, workspace UUID, root UUID, owner token,
disposable purpose, and SHA-256 digest. Preflight/run/smoke/cleanup also resolve
the workspace by UUID through `manage_workspaces`, require the exact name and
root membership, and require the planned root to be the sole root before and
after the campaign. A missing, changed, renamed, system/current-only, or
operator-named substitute is rejected. Workspace creation, root
addition/removal, and visible window changes can request app approval; prepare
the workspace before the campaign.

Write an immutable plan without contacting the app:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py plan \
  --workspace-name "RPCE 8E Bench 20260625T120000Z" \
  --window-id 3 \
  --workspace-id '<workspace-uuid>' \
  --context-id '<context-uuid>' \
  --root-id '<root-uuid>' \
  --root-path /absolute/path/to/large/repository \
  --owner-token "$OWNER_TOKEN" \
  --dataset-label rpce-large \
  --asserted-file-count 100000 \
  --base-ref HEAD \
  --search-marker WorkspaceRootSeedPlanner \
  --read-path Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/WorkspaceContext/Search/WorkspaceRootSeedPlanner.swift \
  --read-marker WorkspaceRootSeedPlanner \
  --invocations-per-series 3 \
  --output /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json
```

`read-path` must name a blob committed in the exact `base-ref`, and that blob
must contain both `search-marker` and `read-marker`. Plan resolves `base-ref` to
an immutable commit OID, verifies the blob through that OID, and freezes both
the commit OID and blob SHA-256. Preflight, run, and smoke re-resolve the symbolic
ref and reject drift; every app/local worktree start uses the stored OID. The rest of a
100k/1M pressure fixture may remain untracked in the parent root, but an
untracked-only marker cannot be inherited by an app-created Git worktree and is
rejected.

`asserted_file_count` is operator-supplied provenance, not an app measurement.
The plan freezes the ownership-marker digest; do not recreate or edit the marker
between cohorts.
The plan is the sole source of truth for required route/process/checkout/width
cells and aggregate thresholds. The current interactive-readiness plan freezes
baseline, forced-full, and projected routes; warm and aged linked-worktree
process states; widths 1/4/8; a 30% primary improvement gate; and a 10%
secondary-regression gate. Cold/main-root evidence is recorded separately as
external provenance. Do not add implicit cold, width-2, 40%, or 5% requirements
in the runner or aggregate. Correctness scenarios still cover nested inherited
Agent Mode, selection and `get_code_structure`, exact-root/cross-root negatives,
non-Git behavior, watcher changes, and ordinary/worktree root churn.

Run schema discovery and exact-scope verification before mutation:

Explicitly enable the DEBUG-only gate for the campaign; the harness verifies it
but never changes this global setting on the operator's behalf:

```bash
agentry-cli-debug -w 3 -c app_settings -j \
  '{"op":"set","key":"agent_mode.worktree_startup_benchmark_diagnostics_enabled","value":true}'
```

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py preflight \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --confirm-live-debug-app
```

Preflight rejects a moved symbolic `base-ref`, rechecks the tracked marker blob
through the stored commit OID, freezes
SHA-256 hashes for the relevant CLI schemas, and requires the DEBUG benchmark
token plus `manage_workspaces.remove_folder`. A marker, schema, or scope change
invalidates the campaign; do not silently substitute IDs.
Restore the gate to its prior value after all run/smoke cleanup completes.

### Route and concurrency cohorts

Run one route/process/checkout/width series at a time. Every retained series
uses one excluded warmup and 3–5 normal samples; five is the release-gate
default. The plan defaults to exactly three invocation artifacts per matrix
cell. Valid slow samples remain included. A rerun gets a new invocation ID and
never replaces the old artifact; an unplanned extra invocation makes the
campaign incomplete rather than supplying replacement samples.

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py run \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --route forced-full \
  --process-state warm \
  --checkout-kind linked-worktree \
  --width 4 \
  --invocation 1 \
  --warmups 1 \
  --samples 5 \
  --confirm-live-debug-app \
  --confirm-process-state
```

Repeat for `baseline`, `forced-full`, and `projected`; process states `cold`,
`warm`, and `aged`; and widths 1/2/4/8. Automated route samples are always
app-created `linked-worktree` starts. `baseline` is the ordinary automatic
full-crawl control.
`forced-full` forces that safe route. `projected` is valid only when the export
contains exactly one `diffSeedServing` publication, no `fullCrawl`, and no
fallback. Observation/full-crawl data is work-attribution evidence, not a
projected-serving latency sample.

Actual-route accounting is exact: baseline and forced-full each require exactly
`{"fullCrawl":1}`, projected requires exactly `{"diffSeedServing":1}`, and
every cohort requires an empty fallback map. Configured route names alone never
satisfy the gate.

The current DEBUG token does not measure initial main-workspace opening. Capture
main-checkout cold/warm root-ready/search/read separately from the existing
restore/readiness diagnostics and retain it beside the campaign; the driver
does not offer a label-only `main` route that could be mistaken for a real
measurement. If that evidence is absent, the final decision is `incomplete`,
never a pass.
Record reviewed external evidence in the same plan namespace rather than
putting an unstructured claim in the scoreboard:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py record-evidence \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --scenario cold-main-workspace-open-root-ready \
  --status pass \
  --details /tmp/cold-main-sanitized-details.json \
  --output /tmp/cold-main-evidence.json
```

Also record `main-checkout-cold-warm-root-search-read`. The other required
records are `fresh-process-provenance`,
`aged-process-session-and-thread-inventory`, and
`host-sleep-and-thermal-validity`. `aggregate --evidence <file>` accepts each
reviewed record; missing or plan-mismatched evidence keeps the gate incomplete.

Each sample records correlation-scoped:

- p50/p95 materialize-to-root-ready, first-search completion, and first-read
  completion;
- first search/read tool duration;
- configured and actual route plus every fallback reason;
- Git command count, family, priority, duration, and queue wait;
- filesystem operation/item/duration counts and codemap attribution;
- process CPU, average/peak core utilization, peak and retained resident memory,
  and peak and retained physical footprint;
- content oracles, receipt ambiguity/eviction, and cleanup state.

Every sample record, diagnostic export, and ordinal has a one-to-one mapping
to a unique correlation UUID and unique Agent Mode session UUID. Aggregation
rejects reuse, disagreement between record/export IDs, duplicate ordinals,
mixed artifact/cohort identities, and extra or missing invocation/sample
counts. Any attempted sample—including an excluded warmup—with route,
attribution, or correctness failure invalidates the cohort and campaign; valid
extras cannot mask it.

### Correctness, watchers, and root churn

Run the smoke lane after route sampling:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py smoke \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --confirm-live-debug-app \
  --confirm-dedicated-workspace
```

The smoke lane uses a script-owned app worktree and temporary roots. It checks:

- the active parent makes exactly 20 calls, alternating ten `file_search` and
  ten `read_file` calls against the tracked marker, then returns exactly
  `RPCE_ACTIVE_PARENT_OK`. Its transcript rejects Bash/shell/exec, delegation,
  any other substitute tool, missing/extra/reordered invocations or paired
  result events, explicitly unsuccessful statuses, or a missing final sentinel.
  `agent_manage.get_log` intentionally emits spartan self-closing result events,
  so the harness does not claim unavailable result payload/status proof; terminal
  `completed` plus the exact sentinel is the available completion evidence;
- a nested child started from the parent context has the exact parent session
  and inherited worktree. The child start is an atomic CLI bind+call explicitly
  routed to the parent context; the child must return a distinct context UUID
  and exactly the same inherited worktree binding ID/path set as the parent.
  Its spartan transcript must contain one ordered `file_search` plus `read_file`
  invocation/result pair, terminal `completed`, and the exact final sentinel;
- every smoke CLI invocation atomically binds its requested context and records
  exactly two JSON documents in order—binding, then final raw tool result—and
  rejects missing, extra, or reordered documents. Validators accept the
  current successful raw shapes (`content_match_groups`, `display_path`,
  selection `files[].root_path/path_within_root`, and code-structure
  `files/issues/summary`) while requiring tool success, the exact bound root,
  exact requested/returned paths, marker content, and no unexpected cross-root
  files (same-root related codemaps are permitted);
- relative result paths require explicit per-file root metadata, a unique root
  prefix, or a single-root atomic binding. Ambiguous roots—including distinct
  roots sharing a basename—and otherwise unattributed relative paths fail;
- selection and explicit/selected `get_code_structure` use runtime root
  UUID/path/type evidence plus binding and per-file root/path evidence to
  exclude cross-root/non-Git substitutions;
- main/worktree/non-Git marker searches do not leak across explicit root filters;
- non-Git search/read work and codemap returns an explicit typed unavailable
  status and issue code rather than a
  graph from another root, with exactly one attributed `get_code_structure`
  work record and zero Git commands;
- watcher create, edit, rename, and delete converge via bounded polling of
  successful exact-binding raw search records;
- before, during, and after every ordinary/linked-worktree add/remove, the
  parent remains `running` on the identical context and the during-poll overlaps
  the mutation interval;
- added roots appear in the exact workspace inventory and pass search/read,
  selection, and codemap checks; removed roots disappear from inventory and
  revoke search/read/selection/codemap state;
- add/remove overlaps at least one in-flight `file_search`, `read_file`,
  selection, or `get_code_structure` subprocess call, rather than claiming a
  race from calls that already completed;
- removed-root search must succeed with zero matches/files searched, selection
  must omit the removed root, and code structure must succeed with
  `status:unavailable` plus `path_not_found`; all are checked against an atomic
  binding that must no longer contain the exact former Git root and an explicit request
  path under that root. `read_file` currently reports removal as an invalid-params
  error, so only the exact former path plus the explicit “not inside any loaded
  folder” rejection is accepted. Generic or mismatched failures are rejected,
  and the surviving root must still succeed through exact binding/path evidence.
  The separate non-Git codemap check instead requires the current non-Git root
  remain present in the binding with typed `git_root_unavailable` evidence.

The harness records and checks parent and child terminal status, removes only
roots it added, cancels/waits only sessions it started, and removes registered,
clean, script-owned worktrees only after every relevant agent is terminal or
cancelled. Cleanup evidence must include terminal agents, removed secondary
roots/worktrees, restored route control, unchanged benchmark setting, successful
diagnostic reset, stopped resource sampling, and restoration to the sole planned
root. Dirty, nonterminal, missing-identity, or otherwise ambiguous resources are
preserved for manual cleanup. Resume interrupted cleanup with:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py cleanup \
  --artifact /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup/v1/<run> \
  --confirm-live-debug-app \
  --confirm-owned-resources
```

Resumed cleanup treats `state.json` resource IDs as selectors, never as ownership
proof. It does not use `agent_manage.list_sessions`, request per-worktree status,
or depend on any inventory limit. It first reads the cheap status-free worktree
inventory, then uses the exact benchmark correlation/control record to recover
the server-known session, target tab, repository, worktree, branch, head, binding,
phase, and physical-path digest. Logical unbind/release and a zero-count
session-specific store-drain snapshot are mandatory before physical deletion.
The final status-free inventory and drain snapshot must remain clear. Missing or
ambiguous identity, timeouts, nonterminal agents, shared roots, open watchers,
queued/applying publications, dirty worktrees, or nonzero drain counts cause no
physical deletion; the action is reported as manual cleanup.

The DEBUG memory sampler returns an immutable `session_id`, rejects every
occupied `start` (including requests that contain legacy `reset:true`), refuses
`reset` while active, and accepts `stop` only for the matching live ID. Normal
teardown stores and stops that exact ID. Resumed cleanup first proves the live
`current.session_id` and label match the recorded artifact, then conditionally
stops that ID; a foreign, missing, failed, or ambiguous session is preserved for
manual cleanup. A stale state-file flag is not accepted. A proven worktree is
removed only after all recorded agents are terminal/cancelled.

Raw CLI responses may contain paths or source snippets. Run directories are
created non-overwriting with mode `0700`; files use `0600`. Review before
sharing. Summary/scoreboard output must not be treated as privacy-scrubbed raw
evidence.

### Mandatory live codemap projection-demand gate

`codemap-gate` is the packaged-app release authority for live codemap demand.
It uses the already-running current DEBUG app, `agentry-cli-debug`, the exact
dedicated workspace plan above, and real `agent_run` sessions. It never builds,
launches, stops, or relaunches the app. Prepare lifecycle state separately with
the approval required by `AGENTS.md`. The planned root must be an owned,
synthetic or explicitly source-allowlisted Git workspace with at least 5,000
supported code files; the existing `plan` command's 100,000-file minimum is a
valid stronger fixture. Each measured directory fixture must remain within the
gate's 100-file output bound; use the separate overflow fixture for rejection.

Create a private fixture JSON. It must contain at least 20 unique individual
files and 20 unique directories. Every marker must occur in the exact tracked
or intentionally synthetic source file named by that entry, and the overflow
directory must contain at least two listed individual fixtures:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "individuals": [
    {"path": "Sources/Large/A.swift", "marker": "CodemapGateA"}
  ],
  "directories": [
    {
      "path": "Sources/Large/DirectoryA",
      "expected_file": "Sources/Large/DirectoryA/Entry.swift",
      "marker": "CodemapDirectoryGateA"
    }
  ],
  "overflow_directory": "Sources/Large/Overflow",
  "watcher_directory": ".rpce-codemap-gate"
}
```

Use a retained, previously accepted `codemap-gate` `summary.json` from the same
fixture digest as the baseline, plus a separately reviewed acceptance ledger.
The ledger is strict JSON and binds the raw summary-file SHA-256, artifact ID,
and fixture SHA-256; one exact entry must match. Supply the ledger's separately
reviewed SHA-256 explicitly so a synthetic summary plus synthetic ledger cannot
self-attest:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "codemap-gate-baseline-ledger",
  "accepted_summaries": [
    {
      "artifact_id": "20260625T000000Z-codemap-gate-example",
      "summary_sha256": "<sha256-of-the-exact-summary.json-bytes>",
      "fixture_sha256": "<fixture_sha256-from-summary.json>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The release gate deliberately refuses a missing, hand-written/unaccepted,
different-fixture, wrong-count, missing-inventory, zero, `NaN`, or infinite
baseline:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py codemap-gate \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --fixture /tmp/rpce-codemap-gate-fixture.json \
  --baseline /tmp/rpce-codemap-retained-baseline/summary.json \
  --baseline-ledger /tmp/rpce-codemap-baseline-ledger.json \
  --baseline-ledger-sha256 <independently-reviewed-ledger-sha256> \
  --cold-samples 20 \
  --warm-samples 40 \
  --confirm-live-debug-app \
  --confirm-dedicated-workspace \
  --confirm-synthetic-allowlisted-source
```

The printed artifact directory is local raw evidence. It contains the exact
`agentry-cli-debug` JSON, agent transcript XML, sample NDJSON, state, cleanup,
resource, fixture, plan, and derived summary files. Directories must remain
`0700` and files `0600`. The final scan fails closed on credential patterns,
the developer checkout, unallowlisted home/private paths, or mode drift.
Only the separate derived `summary.json` shape is shareable: scenario IDs,
hashed relative identifiers, content/presence hashes, statuses, issue codes,
counters, and timings. Do not publish raw artifacts.

The command passes only when all of these gates pass:

1. There are exactly the configured counts (minimum 20 cold and 40 warm) for both the
   individual-file and directory cohorts. Every cold file must first prove
   absence of its exact codemap `+` marker through a non-demanding tree probe;
   warm repetitions reuse those same cold fixtures. All requests use the
   server-owned fixed 10-second readiness deadline. Before live work begins,
   the harness saves `agentry-cli-debug describe get_code_structure` and fails
   immediately if the model-facing schema advertises a caller-controlled
   readiness deadline; no harness or agent request may tune that deadline.
2. Every successful structure request is exactly `ready`, contains the expected
   real codemap marker and a content hash at the current logical path, and is
   followed by an atomically same-context tree request bound to the exact root,
   requested direct parent, full reconstructed logical file path, `+` marker and
   `(+ denotes code-map available)` legend. `partial`/`pending` or a
   readiness-derived subset fails.
3. One small, fail-fast real `agent_run` probe covers two individual files and
   two directories, followed by the inherited-worktree child and concurrent
   ordinary/linked agents; this is not a large inference/stress loop. Raw
   transcripts prove ordered call/result pairs and forbid caller-controlled
   readiness limits.
   Every agent also has exact monotonic timings and structured content/path/tree
   evidence. If transcript result events are spartan, the harness performs the
   exact structure/tree probes atomically in that same session context/worktree
   and records the session-context-binding correlation. Any Bash, shell,
   exec, command, delegation, substitute encoding, unexpected tool, missing
   result, reordering, or wrong final sentinel fails. Spartan self-closing agent
   result events are invocation evidence only and never borrow evidence from an
   unrelated cohort.
4. The primary root continues serving structure while a script-owned secondary
   linked-worktree root is added and removed. A root-targeted DEBUG hold keeps
   the linked-root agent itself running immediately before removal. After
   removal, that exact session/context must terminalize or be cancelled and an
   atomic probe of its old full path must return typed empty revocation with the
   linked root absent from binding and no primary/cross-root fallback.
5. Non-Git search/read succeeds, structure is typed terminal, and the scoped
   build/projection/catalog counters remain unchanged. Watcher
   create/edit/rename/delete publishes only current structure and markers.
   Strict directory overflow returns empty `budget`, `attempted:2`, `limit:1`,
   and zero downstream build/projection/catalog demand.
6. Every directly timed server `get_code_structure` request in raw CLI evidence
   terminates within the 10,000 ms server wait plus 500 ms harness allowance;
   agent calls additionally require ordered paired results and terminal success.
   The held timeout itself must occur within 10,000 ms ± 500 ms and
   report `attempted` in that same band with `limit:10000`; these values come
   from the internal fixed default, never a request field. An immediate mocked
   timeout fails. The DEBUG-only token-owned hold pauses only future projection
   batch admission, auto-expires, and must produce an empty typed `timeout` with
   `readiness_timeout`, issue-level and reply-level retry metadata. Releasing
   the exact hold followed by retry must produce current `ready` content.
7. The baseline must have the exact metric, gate, privacy, configuration, and
   sample inventories; every required p50/p95 is finite and positive, every
   gate passes, privacy is complete, and the separate acceptance-ledger digest
   matches. Separate p50/p95 distributions are present for cold/warm individual
   structure, cold/warm directory structure, tree-marker availability, first
   search, first read, root readiness, projection queue wait, operation
   duration, and memory deltas. Root/search/read p95 and warm structure p50/p95
   may regress no more than 10% from the retained baseline; memory-delta p95
   uses the same fail-closed 10% ceiling.
8. No projection budget/resource counter is exceeded, no byte counter
   saturates, all holds are released or proven expired, only script-owned roots,
   files, agents, and worktrees are removed, memory sampling is stopped, the
   benchmark setting is unchanged, and the workspace returns to its sole
   planned root. Interrupted Git-root removal additionally requires successful
   live `cleanup_worktree_ownership_evidence`; non-Git removal requires its live
   artifact/plan/token-bound marker. Cleanup directly proves every recorded
   session and has no 1,000-session cap.

Any missing raw evidence, missing retry delay, stale path/content/marker,
privacy leak, non-Git codemap work, latency/resource regression, nonterminal
agent, ambiguous ownership, or incomplete cleanup is a hard failure. On an
interrupted run, use the existing `cleanup` command with the artifact path; it
releases or proves expiry of recorded codemap holds and removes recorded added
roots only when its independent ownership checks pass. Temporary non-Git roots
carry an exclusive artifact/plan/token-bound ownership marker; a mutable
`state.json` path or basename prefix is never sufficient deletion proof.

### Aggregation, thresholds, and append-only scoreboard

Aggregate offline after collecting every matrix cell and correctness smoke:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py aggregate \
  --plan /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-plan.json \
  --artifact /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup/v1/<run-1> \
  --artifact /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup/v1/<run-2> \
  --evidence /tmp/cold-main-evidence.json \
  --output /tmp/rpce-worktree-startup-aggregate
```

The aggregate emits `summary.json` and a reviewable
`scoreboard-section.md`. After reviewing evidence and paths, append—never
rewrite—the candidate to
`prompt-exports/optimize-content-addressed-codemaps-runs.md`. The explicit
automation path is guarded and append-only:

```bash
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py aggregate \
  ... \
  --append-scoreboard prompt-exports/optimize-content-addressed-codemaps-runs.md \
  --confirm-append-scoreboard
```

The production-enable gate is all-or-nothing:

1. zero file/folder/search/read/selection/codemap/watcher/root-lifecycle
   correctness mismatches;
2. zero eligible projected fallbacks after warmup;
3. projected p95 improves at least 40% over forced-full for root-ready,
   first-search, and first-read;
4. every other latency p95 regresses no more than 5%;
5. absolute peak/final RSS and physical-footprint growth are each no more than
   10%, including width 8 and aged-app cohorts; signed deltas are report-only,
   and missing, zero, negative, or non-finite control baselines fail closed;
6. artifact IDs, cohort/invocation keys, sample ordinals, correlation UUIDs,
   and session UUIDs are unique, one-to-one, and cannot mix reruns; planned
   invocation and sample counts are exact;
7. every documented CPU/RSS, Git, filesystem, actual-route, and fallback field
   is present and valid: availability is explicit; counts are nonnegative
   integers; Git family and priority totals equal command count; filesystem
   operation/item counts and duration are typed and internally consistent;
   RSS/physical-footprint absolutes are positive finite values with coherent
   peaks/deltas; CPU totals, sample count, duration, and average/peak core
   utilization are finite, ranged, and internally consistent;
8. teardown evidence is complete: agents terminal, secondary roots/worktrees
   removed, memory sampling stopped and independently verified, route/settings
   restored or unchanged, diagnostics reset, and the sole planned root restored.

Missing matrix cells, CPU/physical-footprint data, cold main-root evidence, or
correctness evidence yields `incomplete`. Any recorded invalid attempt yields
`fail`; it is never silently excluded from campaign validity. Never infer a gate
from configured route names, untyped text, generic tool failures, or additional
valid samples.

### 100k synthetic hooks

High-cardinality filesystem ingress replay is no longer an XCTest hook. Use the
Rust inventory-scope / search measurement harnesses when that contract is in
scope:

```bash
make dev-test CARGO_TEST_KIND=full FILTER=inventory_scope
```

This validates spill/streaming scale, not live Agent Mode latency. The live
100k/1M workspace campaign still needs the route, resource, correctness, and
teardown thresholds above.

Script-only validation, with no app or CLI calls:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py --help
python3 Scripts/worktree_startup_live_benchmark.py create-marker --help

```

## Handoff checklist

- Protected contract, plausible defect, chosen layer, and observable oracle.
- Added/renamed/consolidated/removed exact IDs, including complete `old -> new/removed` mappings.
- Exact focused and broader validation commands with results appropriate to the changed boundary.
- Style, guardrail, build, smoke, or packaging evidence when applicable.
- For performance work: measurement protocol, retained evidence, sample validity, and timing comparison.
- Any coverage deliberately omitted, removed, moved to diagnostics, or replaced by a guardrail, with justification.
