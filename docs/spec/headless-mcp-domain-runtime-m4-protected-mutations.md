# Headless MCP domain runtime — M4 protected mutations

> **Historical milestone record.** Focused FILTER names in the evidence tables below include suites later retired. Current mutation-admission coverage is `DomainProtectedMutationSecurityTests`.

Milestone 4 is PR 5/8, stacked on M3 (`feature/headless-runtime-m3-read-discovery`, PR #657). It migrates protected mutation admission into `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` without adding a direct standalone host, AI/Agent execution, credential transport, or M7 cleanup.

## Gate 4A — selection, prompt, routing, and workspace mutations

Gate 4A protects the mutation actions of `manage_selection`, `prompt`, `workspace_context`, `bind_context`, and `manage_workspaces`. Read actions on mixed tools retain their M3 behavior. `file_actions`, `apply_edits`, and `manage_worktree` remain explicitly outside the gate until 4B.

### Authority and parity ledger

| Concern | M4 authority | Compatibility boundary |
|---|---|---|
| mutation classification | `MCPDomainProtectedMutationToolProvider` | existing public names, input schemas, annotations, and physical app providers are unchanged |
| invocation identity | immutable `DomainToolInvocationSecurityContext` installed by `MCPConnectionManager`; connection generation is the coordinator-owned registration token | verified app-proxy transport and run-scoped tool advertisement remain unchanged across routing re-registration |
| persistent headless grants | `DomainMutationPolicyStore`, schema version 1, CAS-written protected-mutation policy | grants bind to a kernel-verified executable fingerprint, and running brokers reload versioned snapshots before admission/precommit |
| approval ordering and settlement | `DomainMutationApprovalBroker` | `WorkspaceApprovalManager` is an AppKit presenter and legacy policy façade |
| policy administration | `repoprompt-mcp policy list|grant|revoke` | mutations require stdin and stderr TTYs plus an immediate `yes` confirmation |
| construction | `ServiceRegistry` wraps every registered binding exactly once | app providers remain physical backends; no second mutation registration exists |

The runtime starts in an explicit construction stage. The 4A commit selected `m4A`; after its focused gate passed, the 4B commit switches production app composition to `m4B`. The configuration default remains `m3Compatibility` for explicit compatibility fixtures. This prevents both partial activation and dual executable mutation paths.

### Security ledger

- Missing, display-name-only, runtime-generation-mismatched, stale-registration, unbound, or otherwise unresolved headless routing contexts default-deny before the physical backend; routing failures are never normalized into an authoritative empty-root scope.
- Verified app-proxy principals preserve current app behavior, including the AppKit approval presenter and proxy backend.
- Run-scoped verified principals require the tool in their immutable ephemeral grant, or a non-expired, non-revoked persistent grant matching `tool.action`, kernel-verified executable fingerprint, optional provider/workspace, and canonical roots.
- All relevant 4A mutations carry canonical-root scope; `manage_workspaces.add_folder` and path-based create requests include the requested new root so a narrow grant cannot expand itself.
- Authorization reloads the persisted versioned snapshot and is revalidated with cancellation immediately before backend execution, making a TTY CLI revoke visible to an already-running broker.
- Persistent grant changes are TTY-administrator-only and compare-and-swap against the durable document.
- Corrupt, future-version, wrong-profile, or externally-conflicted policy enters degraded read-only mode.
- Approval requests have one FIFO active presenter, bounded deadlines, cancellation settlement, presenter-loss settlement, default-deny terminal mapping, and ignored late responses.

### MainActor ledger

`DomainMutationPolicyStore`, `DomainMutationApprovalBroker`, and `MCPDomainProtectedMutationToolProvider` are domain-runtime concurrency authorities and do not depend on AppKit or `@MainActor`. `WorkspaceApprovalManager` remains `@MainActor` only as the compatibility presenter/policy façade. Physical selection, prompt, routing, and workspace backends retain their existing app isolation; the new security decision executes before entering them.

### Review remediation and migration ledger

| Review gate | Resolution |
|---|---|
| B1 registration namespace | invocation and routing use one coordinator-owned registration token; re-registration is observed through the app invocation seam and unresolved routing fails closed |
| B2 physical target fence | app providers admit the translated/resolved physical target and root mapping, then revalidate exact target or nearest-existing-parent identity immediately precommit |
| B3 correlation semantics | public `operation_id` is unchanged and correlation-only; a distinct server-owned request key drives journal ownership and recovery verbs remain retryable |
| H1 live policy visibility | every admission/revalidation refreshes the versioned CAS snapshot, so external revoke/regrant is visible without relaunch |
| H2 principal spoofing | persistent grants match a kernel-derived executable fingerprint; display/provider names are metadata only |
| H3 export writes | `prompt.export` and `workspace_context.export` are durable fenced families |
| H4 DEBUG assurance | DEBUG uses real peer verification by default and exposes an injected verified/unverified identity only to tests; no forced self-PID fallback remains |
| H5 4A roots | canonical roots are passed for relevant 4A mutations and requested new workspace roots are included in authorization |

No M5 AI/Agent execution authority, M6 direct host/backend, or M7 proxy cleanup moved in this remediation.

## Gate 4B — filesystem, apply-edits, and worktree mutations

Gate 4B activates `file_actions`, `apply_edits`, and mutating `manage_worktree` actions through the same `MCPDomainProtectedMutationToolProvider`; the physical app providers remain the single execution backends.

### Security and settlement ledger

| Concern | M4 authority | Commit boundary |
|---|---|---|
| root scope | immutable logical roots/revision plus `WorkspaceRootBindingProjection` physical mappings | the app backend translates/resolves the exact physical target before admission; policy scope remains canonical/logical |
| symlink/TOCTOU fence | `DomainMutationPathFence` | physical root and exact target/nearest-existing-parent device/inode plus resolution are revalidated immediately before physical mutation, detecting symlink and nonexistent-parent swaps |
| durable settlement | `DomainMutationJournal`, schema version 1, CAS-written protected-mutation journal | a server-owned request mutation key elects one writer and settles its exact result; public `operation_id` remains correlation-only and can be reused |
| file actions | existing `MCPServerViewModel.performFileAction` backend | hook follows freshness/argument validation and precedes create/trash/move I/O |
| apply edits | existing `WorkspaceFileEditHost`/`WorkspaceFileMutationService` backend | hook follows path/edit/approval/existence resolution and immediately precedes overwrite/create store I/O |
| worktrees | existing worktree provider and `VCSService` backends | create/apply/continue/abort admit and revalidate their resolved repository/worktree endpoints before settings/Git/session mutation |
| prompt/workspace exports | existing prompt-context provider and file writer | resolved export destinations use the same fence, journal, cancellation, and precommit hook as other filesystem writes |

Relative file paths remain compatible when exactly one authoritative root is bound; ambiguous multi-root relative writes fail closed. Verified app-proxy external worktree creation retains its explicit `allow_external_path` behavior while headless grants remain root-scoped.

Cancellation before the commit hook records `cancelledBeforeCommit` for the internal request key and permits a fresh retry. Once the hook atomically moves the record to `committing`, cancellation or reply loss produces a partial-success diagnostic and durable `indeterminateAfterCommit`; restart refuses automatic reexecution of that exact internal request. Applied records contain the encoded exact MCP result. Public correlation-ID reuse—including worktree merge IDs—does not collide with or poison later continue/abort/retry requests. Active-owner, corrupt/future journal, CAS exhaustion, and interrupted commit all default-deny.

### MainActor ledger

`DomainMutationJournal`, `DomainMutationPathFence`, and the protected provider are AppKit-free domain authorities. Existing physical file/edit/worktree providers retain their current actor isolation. The task-local commit controller crosses into those providers only to revalidate policy/path authority and CAS the durable journal at their physical commit point.
