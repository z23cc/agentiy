# Headless MCP domain runtime M7 — conservative cutover contract and correction evidence

Date: 2026-07-28

Branch: `feature/headless-runtime-m7-cutover`
Base: finalized M6 head `d3677c3e82d171affe08d35587e0bd9bd4561b0f`
Review addressed: `docs/reviews/headless-runtime-m7-cutover-prepush-review-2026-07-28.md`

## Backend contract

`repoprompt-mcp` accepts `--backend app|headless|auto`; MCP stdio continues to default to `app`. The default must not move to `auto` until explicit live and release evidence demonstrates app-available/no-app behavior, state continuity, retries, and latency.

`auto` remains an explicit preview mode. Selection is made exactly once before the first `initialize` read:

- explicit `app` and `headless` never probe;
- explicit `auto` performs one bounded, connect-only probe of the well-known app socket;
- an available app selects the existing proxy/reconnect path;
- an unavailable app selects the M6 direct runtime;
- no initialized process retries or switches backend;
- interactive and exec modes are app-only and reject explicit `headless` and `auto`;
- bare backend values and duplicate backend options fail with usage status.

The probe verifies a Unix socket node, connects with a 150 ms bound, transmits no protocol bytes, closes its descriptor, and never examines the private M6 child endpoint. All app-generated MCP configurations, including provider child configuration, explicitly pass `--backend app`. The production entry point records this result as one immutable `MCPBackendDecision`; the older `resolve` method remains only a compatibility projection for existing callers and tests.

## Canonical state and workspace semantics

Default headless mode uses the canonical RepoPrompt CE application-support root and the same workspace storage root selected by the app. It never derives user state from the process current working directory and never invents `Headless/default` storage.

A nondefault named headless profile requires `REPOPROMPT_MCP_HEADLESS_PROFILE_DIR`. Explicit working roots may bootstrap a synthetic workspace only inside that intentional isolated profile. Empty or duplicate explicit roots fail closed.

Direct workspace/read/search/tree/selection/prompt behavior is implemented by `MCPDomainCanonicalWorkspaceService` in `RepoPromptDomainRuntime`. `DirectHeadlessWorkspaceBackend` is a physical adapter that supplies snapshots, mutations, and path resolution; it no longer contains a second file-reading, search, tree, selection, or token-accounting implementation.

## App admission and catalog semantics

Public `bind_context` `window_id` and legacy working-directory window selection translate the selected presentation window to its exact active tab/workspace logical context at admission and persist that authoritative context. Hidden `_windowID` performs the same translation for one call. Both fail closed if the selected window has no active logical context. Later active-tab changes cannot redirect admitted work, and no active-tab execution fallback was restored.

Provider-built app tools retain their existing `MCPAppToolBinder` envelope and are canonicalized without a second `runTool` wrapper. Raw shared bindings receive one envelope. Duplicate, invalid, or noncanonical catalog materialization throws a typed error during authoritative registration rather than trapping. Exact scope coverage again requires `read_file` to have only its single window registration scope.

The app physical boundary is grouped into five typed capability families:

- `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters.Execution`
- `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters.Context`
- `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters.Selection`
- `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters.Files`
- `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters.Prompt`

The retired flat closure dependency-bag contract is absent from the frozen ownership fixture and guarded against returning.

## Lifecycle and cleanup

- `MCPService.start()` is the process-owned transport start operation.
- `join(windowID:)` and `leave(windowID:)` attach/detach presentation only and cannot start, stop, or resurrect transport.
- Explicit shutdown remains stopped after a later window attachment.
- `restoredBinding`, `TabContextResolutionPolicy`, `shouldSkipGenericTabBinding`, `tabBindingTroubleshooting`, window-only binding snapshots, migrated-tool branching, active-tab compatibility switches, and bare cleanup blocks are removed.
- A missing connection ID in read-file auto-selection admission produces controlled invalid-params behavior rather than `preconditionFailure`.
- Positive active-context token-accounting/coalescing tests cover the still-live `presentationActiveContext` branch.

## Test-ledger reconciliation

The curated ledger adds reviewed rows for parser edges, canonical state roots, app-child backend pinning, exact window-context admission, catalog single-envelope/fail-closed behavior, and restored token accounting. It renames the old headless-only mode-rejection row to the broader non-app contract and updates the lifecycle row to include post-shutdown attachment.

Authoritative list tickets:

- root: `f2bde283-9275-449e-ac68-3aad38285c7b`;
- provider: `c5fb9c47-56da-441b-92e2-2106d3c63857`.

Final exact-ID verification used fresh list tickets `bc4a0410-ffae-4315-8191-86c22fe06a16` and `68dae8ec-5d16-4926-92be-a6a984e73259` and passed with 3,768 methods.

## Remaining validation gates

- `make dev-codex-schema-check` remains locally blocked because installed Codex `0.144.1` is below the repository contract floor `0.145.0` (ticket `56f0f2d1-ba64-4c6e-ab9b-7b8070f00699`).
- A full `ToolCatalogSnapshotTests` class attempt compiled and exercised the new exact tests, but entered bootstrap retry paths while a visible app owned the socket; it was canceled rather than stopping/relaunching the app. The new catalog, lifecycle, and exact-scope methods pass independently above.
- No full root-suite rerun is claimed for this correction pass. The bounded focused owners, provider suite, exact ledger, products, lint, and guardrails pass.
- No live app proxy/no-app auto matrix, packaging, release artifact, latency comparison, or state-loss/retry evidence was produced. The task explicitly forbids app relaunch and requires the branch to remain local.

These gaps are why `app` remains the default. Moving the default to `auto` is a later release decision, not part of this M7 correction.

## M7 backend cutover and release evidence gate (2026-08-31)

This phase freezes the machine-checkable backend and release boundary in:

- `Scripts/Fixtures/headless_mcp_domain_runtime_m7_contract.json`
- `Scripts/Fixtures/headless_mcp_domain_runtime_m7_evidence.json`
- `Scripts/validate_m7_backend_release.py`

`make m7-backend-certification` (or coordinated `make dev-m7-backend-certification`) executes the offline backend-selection tests, deterministic FFI code-generation check, focused direct-process tests, source guardrails, and the strict contract/evidence validator. It requires no credentials, network access, visible-app launch, or workspace mutation. It rejects unknown/missing checks, duplicate JSON keys, probe-budget drift, protocol-byte probes, stale evidence paths, and any attempt to authorize `auto` as the default.

The committed evidence intentionally records live provider smoke, app/no-app auto matrix, sleep/wake soak, and signed release artifact as `deferred`. These require separately authorized operational runs and are not inferred from synthetic tests. Consequently the gate does not change runtime routing and `app` remains the default. A future release decision must replace each deferred row with independently captured evidence before changing that default.

## M7 completion criteria

- Backend resolution is one immutable pre-initialize `MCPBackendDecision` with an explicit probe budget.
- App and direct modes continue to share the canonical `Workspaces` state root; no `Headless` storage is created.
- Offline certification executes and source guardrails are machine-checked through the coordinated release lane.
- Live credentials, visible-app lifecycle, sleep/wake, signing, and automatic default cutover remain explicit deferred gates.
