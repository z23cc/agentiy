Branch: `feature/headless-runtime-m6-direct-backend`
Base: finalized local `feature/headless-runtime-m5-ai-agent`

## Gate 6A boundary

Gate 6A introduces `MCPDomainHost` in `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` as the protocol-neutral owner of:

- immutable canonical catalog snapshots;
- exact application/window binding resolution;
- registry-generation and connection-generation fencing immediately before invocation;
- authoritative `DomainToolInvocationSecurityContext` installation;
- active invocation ownership, per-connection cancellation, and bounded runtime drain.

The app remains a transport and presentation shell. `MCPDomainHost` owns canonical policy filtering, connection registrations and replacement generations, admission lanes, resource leases, progress state, watchdog execution, settlement, delivery accounting, terminal fencing, and bounded drain. `ServerNetworkManager` adapts app/window routing, tool-card publication, observer callbacks, result formatting, and physical transport delivery to those runtime capabilities. It obtains catalog snapshots and exact resolutions from `MCPDomainHost`; connection removal terminal-fences and cancels the exact host generation.

`MCPService` receives an injected host-bootstrap operation. The production default performs the existing one-time Codex tool-timeout migration before listener startup; tests and later standalone composition can supply a different bootstrap without duplicating lifecycle ownership.

## Compatibility invariants

Gate 6A does not change:

- the default CLI backend or bootstrap Unix socket;
- `MCPInitializeReplayState`, outstanding-request replay, or the JSON-RPC bridge ledger;
- listener/replacement, approval, retry, terminal, kill, or response-delivery contracts;
- tool schemas, policy visibility, wire envelopes, or app/window routing behavior;
- physical app provider composition.

The host does not infer windows, format MCP results, dispatch a second JSON-RPC loop, or access AppKit/MainActor state.

## Bounded drain contract

Host drain cancels all owned invocations and polls actor-owned settlement state only until the configured deadline. It deliberately does not use a structured task-group race, because exiting such a group waits for an uncooperative child and would make the deadline unbounded. A provider that ignores cancellation remains accounted as detached until its original invocation settles; new invocations fail closed once drain begins.

## Gate 6A corrective review closure

The review follow-up closes the host lifecycle blocker and shipping-lifecycle highs without changing proxy wire behavior:

- invocation validation may suspend, but the final lifecycle check and active-invocation insertion are now one actor-isolated, suspension-free admission step; `beginDrain` therefore cannot miss a late untracked invocation;
- drain observes caller cancellation explicitly, returns a distinct `callerCancelled` result, and never catches cancellation only to re-enter a hot polling loop;
- the host-created provider task is an explicitly owned operation: it is inserted before the actor yields, indexed by invocation and connection, cancelled by caller/connection/drain, and retained in detached accounting until terminal settlement;
- the shipping `AppDelegate` termination barrier now awaits `MCPDomainRuntime.shutdown()` after agent-session and MCP-server teardown;
- domain-host queue and execution timings flow through `DomainRuntimeMetricsSink` into the `EditFlow.MCPToolCall.DomainHost.QueueWait` and `EditFlow.MCPToolCall.DomainHost.Execution` stages with tool, outcome, and microsecond dimensions.

## Gate 6A protocol-neutral policy and resource admission ownership

The A3 extraction moves canonical `tools/list` filtering, two-stage `tools/call` policy decisions, admission classification, admission-limit constants, and keyed application/window resource admission into `RepoPromptDomainRuntime`:

- `MCPDomainHost.advertisedCatalog` owns disabled, restricted, explicit-grant, and role visibility ordering over one registry snapshot;
- `evaluateEarlyCallPolicy` and `evaluatePreAdmissionCallPolicy` preserve the existing early grant-denial versus later restricted/role/admission-class ordering, while `ServerNetworkManager` maps typed outcomes to the existing byte-identical user errors;
- `MCPDomainToolResourceAdmissionController` is the physical cancellation-safe FIFO lease authority, including repository resource identity for standalone composition;
- the host owns the mutation and small-read controllers; the app keeps only routing-to-resource selection, timing evidence, and the intentional explicit release boundary before formatter/observer tails;
- the app compatibility controller name is now only a typealias used by the existing focused tests;
- `MCPRequestProgressState`, its delivery result, and the transport-only actor capability live in the runtime; the host owns connection-generation-bound request handles, finish invalidation, connection-cancel invalidation, and drain invalidation, while the app adapter keeps the legacy RepoPrompt CLI control fallback and physical `MCP.Server.notify` write.

### Review follow-up: final admission and drain closure

The branch-range Gate 6A review identified three additional reentrancy gaps, all closed before beginning Gate 6B:

- connection removal now terminal-fences the exact connection generation in the host before any cleanup suspension; final invocation admission and request-progress creation reject that generation;
- duplicate invocation IDs are rechecked in the same suspension-free final admission block as lifecycle and connection-terminal state, preventing task-ownership overwrite;
- host drain closes both host-owned resource controllers, fails queued acquisitions, waits for outstanding leases, and publishes admission counts in its snapshot.

## Gate 6B — standalone preview

Gate 6B exposes only the explicit `--backend headless` preview. The parser still defaults to
`app`, rejects headless interactive/exec combinations, and leaves automatic selection to M7.

The production direct composition:

- constructs `MCPDomainRuntime` in standalone mode with an isolated profile and
  `DomainPersistenceCoordinator` storage;
- registers a real `.standalone` scope rather than a synthetic window;
- installs all 27 Swift-owned canonical definitions and applies the long-running and
  protected-mutation decorators;
- reuses `MCPDomainReadToolProvider` for the nine migrated reads and the extracted production
  apply-edits/diff substrate for operation-ID, revision, retry, and path-fence semantics;
- adapts physical capability families through Foundation/Sendable protocols without importing
  AppKit, SwiftUI, or `MCPServerViewModel`;
- installs one MCP SDK server over the terminal-aware `MCPStdioServerTransport`, with one-hop
  delivery accounting and explicit EOF/read/poll/PPID/broken-pipe/cancellation provenance;
- carries nested Agent/Context Builder calls through an owner-only, inode-fenced Unix endpoint
  and a single-use runtime-generation/peer-identity launch token;
- cancels and awaits provider, endpoint, and reader tasks before bounded runtime drain.

`MCPFoundationStandaloneBackend`, generated schema manifests/recorders, and live-window schema
authorities are absent. `Scripts/headless_runtime_guardrails.sh` enforces those constraints.

### Gate 6B private child endpoint closure (M6B)

The nested-provider handoff is now a production boundary rather than an injected harness claim.
`DomainChildLaunchAuthority` validates the exact run/provider/purpose credential scope, then orders
routing-token reservation and optional credential-envelope issuance; it rolls the token back if
envelope creation fails or token material is malformed. `DirectHeadlessChildEndpoint` owns
only the private Unix socket: it creates an owner-only `0700` directory and `0600` socket, publishes
a device/inode descriptor after `listen`, rejects non-descendant peer PIDs, and performs bounded,
identity-fenced cleanup. `DirectHeadlessChildBridge` captures and verifies that descriptor immediately
before connecting and sends it in the private handshake.

The routing coordinator validates the run ID before transitioning a launch token to `consumed`;
wrong-run, wrong-principal, wrong-provider, generation-stale, expired, and replayed handshakes
therefore leave the active token untouched or return its bounded tombstone. MCP handlers are
installed only after endpoint and token admission succeeds. All seven carrier fields (endpoint,
endpoint identity, token, envelope reference, principal, provider, and run ID) are stripped before
any task-local carrier is merged at a final provider spawn boundary. The public MCP wire catalog and
provider arguments remain unchanged; automatic app/headless selection remains a later M7 concern.
