# Generated Xcode Workspace

Agentry provides a generated, disposable Xcode workspace for development convenience. `Package.swift` and `Package.resolved` remain the canonical target graph and dependency lock; conductor, SwiftPM, and `Scripts/package_app.sh` remain the authoritative build, test, and app-packaging paths.

## Generate and open

Xcode 26 and Python 3 are required.

```bash
make xcode            # generate and open
make xcode-generate   # generate without opening
make xcode-check      # verify existing output is current
make xcode-validate   # regenerate, check structure, and run xcodebuild -list
make xcode-clean      # remove generated workspace metadata
```

The generator writes `.build/xcode/Agentry.xcworkspace`. Everything under `.build/xcode` is derived and ignored; never edit or commit it. Regenerate after changes to the package manifest, lockfile, generator, or Xcode workflow wrapper. `make xcode` generates the workspace before opening it; use `make xcode-validate` when explicit package-acquisition and `xcodebuild -list` validation is required.

## Schemes in Xcode 26.3

Xcode exposes SwiftPM product schemes, including `Agentry` and `agentry-mcp`, alongside three repository convenience schemes:

The native `Agentry` product scheme exposes the shipped product and emitted binary. Internally, its `RepoPrompt` executable target remains a one-file entry target over the `RepoPromptApp` implementation library. `RepoPromptApp` is an internal SwiftPM target rather than a declared library product, so it does not add a supported product or convenience scheme. The AppKit-free `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` and direct `RepoPromptDomainRuntimeTests` owner target are likewise internal package targets discovered from the same manifest; they do not add product or convenience schemes.

- `Agentry App` delegates to conductor to assemble the real debug app through the existing packaging flow, verifies the `.build/debug/Agentry.app` compatibility path, then runs the local debug bundle under `~/Library/Application Support/Agentry/DebugApps/Agentry.app`.
- `Agentry MCP` delegates to conductor to build and run `.build/debug/agentry-mcp`.
- `Agentry Tests` delegates to the conductor test runner. Root tests import `RepoPromptApp`, but retain their separate `RepoPromptMCP` dependency/imports; the scheme remains a legacy build target rather than a native Xcode test bundle because `RepoPromptMCP` is executable-only.

The native product schemes are useful for source navigation and indexing. Use `Agentry Tests` for the supported full test workflow; optional `AGENTRY_XCODE_TEST_FILTER` narrows the delegated run. External dependency test targets are not added to RepoPrompt schemes. Sparkle's vendored XCFramework declares a `dSYMs` directory that is not present in the repository, so native Xcode package builds involving the app can fail before compilation. The generator deliberately does not mutate `Vendor/`; the packaged app convenience scheme remains the supported app build.

## Boundaries

This workflow is Debug-only. It does not define a second source graph, alter `Package.swift`, replace SwiftPM test resources, or support release/archive packaging. The app scheme permits ad-hoc signing when no stable identity is available; set `AGENTRY_XCODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` to choose an Apple Development identity explicitly. Ad-hoc builds use ephemeral secure storage.

Generated app, MCP, and test builds are conductor-coordinated. Xcode cancellation can stop waiting without canceling the queued daemon job; inspect `./conductor job list` before retrying. The explicit `AGENTRY_XCODE_UNCOORDINATED=1` fallback is build/test-only. Xcode Run still requires conductor so its pre-launch action can perform exact-executable lifecycle handling safely.

## Validation ownership

`Scripts/test_xcode_workspace_generator.py` protects deterministic output, the thin `RepoPrompt` → `RepoPromptApp` manifest topology, the internal `RepoPromptDomainRuntime`/owner-test topology and app/test consumer edges, bridging-header and test dependency ownership, scheme wiring, safe destinations, and stale-output detection. Local `pr-ready` runs this contract on generator-boundary paths. Full `make xcode-validate` is explicit or `workflow_dispatch`.

Full generated-workspace validation, including official dependency acquisition and the heavier `xcodebuild -list` check in `make xcode-validate`, is explicit. Run it locally when needed, or dispatch the dedicated `Xcode Workspace Validation` workflow. Docs-only Xcode architecture changes remain guardrails-only unless that explicit validation is requested.
