# Source Layout Ownership Map

Current as of 2026-07-19 after the source-layout refactor, provider extraction, upstream Tree-sitter grammar migration, the thin-executable split, and the workspace, regex, and CodeMap core boundaries. This document is contributor-facing: use it to decide where new source, tests, fixtures, diagnostics, shared protocol code, and guardrail checks belong.

```

The external products and emitted binaries are `Agentry` and `agentry-mcp`. The internal `RepoPrompt` executable target remains a one-file entry shell delegating to `RepoPromptApp`; internal module and target names are intentionally unchanged. `RepoPromptApp` is not declared as a library product or separate Xcode convenience scheme. `RepoPromptCodeMapCore`, `RepoPromptSearchCore`, `RepoPromptWorkspaceCore`, and `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` are internal dependencies of `RepoPromptApp`, are not exposed as package products, and have direct owning test targets. `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` owns the AppKit-free, Sendable MCP runtime identity/lifecycle values, the canonical 27-tool name/capability/admission/client-policy catalog, immutable definitions and fingerprints, and the actor registry. App registration is process composition over that registry; no app-local registry facade or second schema authority remains. `RepoPromptCodeMapCoreTests` is the sole resource owner for pure CodeMap parser fixtures and goldens. Root app tests import `RepoPromptApp`; the separate `RepoPromptMCP` executable dependency remains unchanged.

## Rust core and FFI ownership

The Phase 0 Rust foundation lives in the virtual workspace under `rust/`; it is subordinate to the repository build orchestration rather than a second top-level product graph. Its minimal members and dependency direction are:

```text
rust/crates/proto       # agentry-proto: versioned payload contracts; no runtime or FFI dependency
        ↑
rust/crates/runtime     # agentry-runtime: future Tokio/registry/queue owner; no UniFFI dependency
        ↑
rust/crates/ffi         # agentry-ffi: the only product crate allowed to depend on UniFFI

rust/tools/xtask        # repository-only artifact/codegen tool; not a product crate
```

Future domain crates belong under `rust/crates/domain/<domain>/`, binaries under `rust/bins/<product>/`, and repository tools under `rust/tools/<tool>/`. Phase 0 intentionally does not create empty domain or binary crates before they have an owned behavior boundary. All members share `rust/Cargo.lock`, the pinned `rust/rust-toolchain.toml`, the arm64-only `rust/.cargo/config.toml`, and workspace lint/profile policy.

When the Swift bridge is introduced, its only permitted dependency chain is:

```text
AgentryCoreBridgeTests → AgentryCoreBridge → AgentryUniFFIRaw
  → CAgentryRustCore → libagentry_ffi.a
```

`RepoPromptApp`, existing executable targets, and existing app integration tests must not directly import or depend on `AgentryUniFFIRaw`. Generated bindings and headers are reviewed artifacts but remain private implementation detail behind the handwritten bridge. First-party product logic is Swift + Rust: the only C-family product files allowed outside third-party roots are `Sources/CAgentryRustCore/shim.c` and the generated `Sources/CAgentryRustCore/include/AgentryCoreFFI.h`; the C/C++ files under the explicit CodeMap fixture roots are copied parser data, not compiled product sources. The Phase 0 contracts, gates, fixture rules, and dependency policy are documented in [`rust-ffi.md`](rust-ffi.md). Per-domain Rust boundary/wire contracts for later phases live alongside it: [`rust-inventory-scope-v1.md`](rust-inventory-scope-v1.md), [`rust-search-leaf-v1.md`](rust-search-leaf-v1.md), [`rust-codemap-compact-v1.md`](rust-codemap-compact-v1.md), [`rust-apply-edits-compact-v1.md`](rust-apply-edits-compact-v1.md), and (Phase 6, Claude vertical) [`rust-agent-claude-v1.md`](rust-agent-claude-v1.md).

The legacy top-level layer buckets under `Sources/RepoPrompt` have been pruned and must not be recreated:

- `Models`
- `Notifications`
- `Services`
- `Shared`
- `Utils`
- `ViewModels`
- `Views`
- `Features/SynthaxParsing`
- `Features/Benchmark`

## Post-native-tree terminology

The old native file-tree visualization is no longer a live product surface. Do not add back `AgentFileTreeBottomPanelView`, `FileTreeViewWrapper`, `FileTreeViewController`, `NativeFileTree`, or `SearchFileTreeViewModel` source paths/symbols.

“File tree” remains valid when it refers to compatibility or textual context contracts, including the MCP `get_file_tree` tool, tool result cards, API/persisted symbols such as `FileTreeOption`, historical plans, and prompt/context output such as `<file_map>` / project structure maps. Contributor-facing UI and docs should prefer “project structure map” when describing generated textual context so it is not confused with the removed native UI.

The old IDE-era Prompt selected-files panel is also removed. Do not add back `PresetBottomBar`, `SelectedFilesContentView`, `SelectedFilesPanelViewModel`, or the Prompt-owned copy/chat preset picker helpers. The compact Prompt selected-files UI remains `SelectedFilesGrid` plus `FilePreviewPopover`. Agent Mode owns its current selected-context workflow in Context Composer under `Features/AgentMode/Views/ContextDrawer`; see [`context-composer.md`](context-composer.md). The Settings chat preset picker lives under `Features/Settings`. Textual file previews use the read-only `TextKitView`; app syntax queries remain a separate parsing and validation concern rather than a colored preview renderer.

## Placement rules for new files

- `Sources/RepoPromptExecutable` is restricted to the shipped executable entry. Do not add lifecycle, feature, infrastructure, startup, or composition logic there.
- Deterministic workspace path values and policies with no app, UI, persistence, filesystem, process, or mutable authority may go under `Sources/RepoPromptWorkspaceCore`; direct tests go under `Tests/RepoPromptWorkspaceCoreTests`. The target is not a general non-UI bucket.
- AppKit-free search result values and deterministic Rust-backed path filtering belong under `Sources/RepoPromptSearchCore`; direct differential and filter tests belong under `Tests/RepoPromptSearchCoreTests`. Workspace/store readiness, ingress freshness, app diagnostics, `FileViewModel`/catalog adapters, and `StoreBackedWorkspaceSearchLane` remain app-owned while they depend on `WorkspaceFileContextStore` or app telemetry authority.
- AppKit-free MCP runtime identity/lifecycle configuration, canonical tool names, capability/admission/client classification, normalized schema fingerprints, Sendable tool definitions/bindings, the actor registry, workspace/context document and journal persistence, revision/CAS/event publication, connection/context routing, and run-launch-token authority belong under `Sources/RepoPromptDomainRuntime`; owner tests belong under `Tests/RepoPromptDomainRuntimeTests`. Application-scoped app-settings and routing registration is process-lifetime composition owned: AppDelegate startup explicitly registers canonical bindings and starts transport independently of window count, while catalog readiness only observes the canonical registry with a bounded fail-closed wait. App-side window and active-context values are presentation affinity, never domain identity or mutation authority. `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` must contain no `@MainActor`, AppKit, SwiftUI, Combine, window, or view-model dependency.
- Deterministic synchronous CodeMap grammar descriptors, CodeMap-only queries, invocation-local parsing/extraction, provenance-free decoded source values, pipeline/key canonical encoding, artifact outcomes, and path-free canonical rendering belong under `Sources/RepoPromptCodeMapCore`; pure fixtures/goldens and owner tests belong only under `Tests/RepoPromptCodeMapCoreTests`.
- Keep CodeMap decoding and raw-digest construction, validation/Git/worktree provenance, permits/cancellation, environment/performance aggregation, CAS/persistence, workspace authority, token/path/import presentation, syntax-query validation, UI/MCP, and selection-graph policy in `RepoPromptApp`. P2 step 13: syntax parsing moved to the Rust core; no Swift target links tree-sitter. `SyntaxManager` is a thin facade over `CodeMapSyntaxEngine` (language detection + pipeline-identity mirror).
- New product-flow code goes under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/<FeatureName>`.
- New app lifecycle, launch/configuration, command, root view/view-model, notification-name, and composition-root wiring goes under `Sources/RepoPrompt/App` in the `RepoPromptApp` target.
- Keep bridging-header-sensitive support under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Support`, owned by `RepoPromptApp`, unless `Package.swift` is updated in the same change.
- New cross-cutting service/platform code goes under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/<Area>`.
- Provider-neutral workflow IDs, catalog metadata, and prompt renderers go under `Sources/RepoPromptShared/Workflows/`; do not add new workflow prompts under provider-specific command names or bundled `AppResources/Services/AI/Prompts` mirrors.
- New reusable SwiftUI components, text/markdown helpers, and UI services should prefer a narrow feature owner first; otherwise use `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/UI/<Area>`.
- New generic extensions/helpers should prefer a narrow feature or infrastructure owner first; otherwise use `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/Utilities`.
- New app-visible diagnostic surfaces go under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/Diagnostics` and must have a documented purpose and entry point.
- New app/CLI protocol definitions shared by both executables go under `Sources/RepoPromptShared`.
- MCP filesystem/product/build-flavor identity and external-client event wire DTOs are single-sourced under `Sources/RepoPromptShared/MCP`; app/helper targets may keep only local compile-flavor selection and app-only presentation behavior.
- New app-local MCP/socket/routing helpers go under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/MCP`, not `Sources/RepoPrompt/Shared`. App tool providers receive only the typed physical capability families they require; `MCPAppPhysicalCapabilityAdapters` is a namespace, not an umbrella dependency bag or dynamic-member façade.
- Reusable AppKit-free physical workspace operations used by direct MCP belong in `RepoPromptDomainRuntime`; `RepoPromptMCP` may adapt them but must not copy read/search/tree/selection implementations. App presentation adapters may add UI-specific policy without becoming domain identity authority. Durable compose-tab selection and context mutations cross the typed Domain command boundary (`replaceSelection` / `replaceContext`) before any stored-tab mirror is applied; path/codemap policy and UI propagation remain presentation concerns.
- New CLI-only implementation code goes under `Sources/RepoPromptMCP`. Direct backend selection and stdio composition stay here; canonical schemas, workspace state roots, and reusable physical workspace operations do not.
- App-owned test doubles, integration fixtures, sample projects, benchmark-only data, and XCTest-only helpers go under `Tests/RepoPromptTests`, not the app target. Pure CodeMap parser fixtures/goldens are the documented exception and belong only to `RepoPromptCodeMapCoreTests`.
- Do not create directories named `Tests`, `TestSupport`, or `Fixtures` under `Sources/RepoPrompt`.
- Do not put parser fixtures or sample parser inputs under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Infrastructure/SyntaxParsing`; keep only production parser/query code there.
- Keep `App/WindowState.swift` in `App` until there is a separate composition-root refactor; physical moves must preserve initialization order.

## Exception policy

Exceptions must be explicit, narrow, and documented here before they become precedent.

### App-visible diagnostics retained in the RepoPromptApp target

These files are intentionally compiled as app-integrated diagnostics and live under `Sources/RepoPrompt/Features/Diagnostics`:

- `Features/Diagnostics/Benchmark`: the Settings-visible Repo Bench surface, including benchmark core, settings UI/view model, run store, reporting, and local rankings. If Repo Bench needs a headless/CI runner, create a separate executable-target plan rather than hiding target churn in this layout cleanup.
- `Features/Diagnostics/AgentMode`: debug-only Agent Mode performance instrumentation and text-derivation diagnostics.
- `Features/Diagnostics/AgentMode/Stress`: debug-only Agent chat stress launch configuration, harness, overlay panel, and stress support extensions on `AgentModeViewModel`, launched with `-RP_AGENT_CHAT_STRESS` and `RP_AGENT_STRESS_*` environment variables.
- `Features/Diagnostics/MCP`: hidden DEBUG MCP diagnostics, transport diagnostics, Sparkle diagnostics, and memory sampling exposed through `__repoprompt_debug_diagnostics` / legacy debug transport tools.
- `Features/Diagnostics/Prompt`: DEBUG prompt/token recount event forwarding, selection signatures, and selected-path watchdog state surfaced through restore performance diagnostics.
- `Features/Diagnostics/CodeMap`: DEBUG CodeMap initial-root-load timing wrappers surfaced through restore performance diagnostics.
- `Features/Diagnostics/App`: app-wide font-scale metrics, workspace/window restore performance logging, and DEBUG root-load trace correlation (`WorkspaceRootLoadDiagnostics`) surfaced through restore/workspace loading diagnostics.

### Documented wiring exceptions outside Diagnostics

- `App/AppLaunchConfiguration.swift` remains in `App` because it owns process arguments/environment interpretation for launch behavior. It still routes DEBUG-only Agent chat stress settings, but harness-specific configuration lives under `Features/Diagnostics/AgentMode/Stress`.
- `App/WindowState.swift` remains the composition root and continues to instantiate/pause the DEBUG-only `AgentChatStressHarness`. This is wiring only; harness implementation lives under Diagnostics.
- `Infrastructure/Security/EphemeralSecureKeyValueStore.swift` remains with security storage code, not Diagnostics, because it is a required debug-app secure-storage backend rather than a fixture or visible diagnostic harness. It is `#if DEBUG`, in-memory only, and preserves existing debug behavior for ad-hoc/ephemeral secure storage.

No top-level `Sources/RepoPrompt/Notifications` exception remains; app-wide notification-name extensions now live under `Sources/RepoPrompt/App/Notifications`.

### Tree-sitter scanner linker compatibility target

- P2 step 13 (2026-08-21): the entire Swift tree-sitter supply chain was deleted — the `SwiftTreeSitter` wrapper fork, all 13 grammar packages, and the `TreeSitterScannerSupport` scanner shim. Parsing runs exclusively in the Rust core (`rust/crates/runtime/src/codemap/`), which vendors the upstream grammars as Rust crates. `Scripts/source_layout_guardrails.sh` now enforces the negative: no tree-sitter package, product, target, or import may return to the Swift graph. Upstream grammar license texts remain under `ThirdPartyLicenses/tree-sitter/` because the same third-party code ships via `rust/`.

## Generated IDE artifacts

The generated Xcode workspace lives under `.build/xcode` and is not part of the
source layout or a second target graph. `Package.swift` continues to own source,
target, dependency, and test-resource membership. Edit the generator and
workflow wrapper under `Scripts`, then regenerate; never edit or track generated
workspace files. See [`xcode-workspace.md`](xcode-workspace.md).

## Guardrails

Run the source-layout guardrails before or after source-layout-sensitive changes:

```bash
make guardrails
# or
./Scripts/source_layout_guardrails.sh
```

The guardrail script verifies:

- the shipped `RepoPrompt` executable source root contains only its entry file, declares exactly one `@main`, and the `RepoPromptApp` implementation declares none;
- `RepoPromptCodeMapCore`, `RepoPromptSearchCore`, `RepoPromptWorkspaceCore`, `RepoPromptDomainRuntime`, and their owning test targets retain internal manifest topology and remain unexposed as products; the domain runtime remains AppKit/MainActor/provider/workspace-authority free, and app composition registers directly with its canonical registry without a compatibility facade; the CodeMap core owns language detection and the Rust pipeline-fingerprint mirror (no tree-sitter linkage anywhere in the Swift graph);
- `Package.swift` keeps the `RepoPrompt` executable as a thin dependency on the internal `RepoPromptApp` target at `Sources/RepoPrompt`;
- old top-level layer buckets are absent or contain no files;
- no `Tests`, `TestSupport`, or `Fixtures` directories exist under `Sources/RepoPrompt`;
- `MCPControlMessages.swift` and `MCPFilesystemIdentity.swift` exist only under `Sources/RepoPromptShared/MCP`, and the `MCPExternalClientEvent` wire DTO is declared only there;
- parser fixtures/sample inputs do not live under app syntax parsing source;
- no tree-sitter package appears in `Package.swift` or `Package.resolved`; retired local grammar directories remain absent; the codemap pipeline fingerprint mirror (`CodeMapPipelineFingerprints.swift`) stays byte-synchronized to the Rust authority via `rust/crates/runtime/tests/codemap_query_contract.rs`;
- Agent/MCP runtime code does not depend on `WorkspaceFilesViewModel`, `FileViewModel`, or `FolderViewModel`;
- removed native-tree/search artifact paths are not tracked again;
- removed native-tree/search/eager-loading symbols such as `AgentFileTreeBottomPanelView`, `FileTreeViewWrapper`, `FileTreeViewController`, `NativeFileTree`, `SearchFileTreeViewModel`, `RootDescendantMaterialization`, `legacyMaterializedRootKeys`, `legacyMaterializeDescendantsRecursively`, and `legacyEager` are not referenced from app source;
- removed Prompt UI cleanup artifacts (`PresetBottomBar.swift`, `SelectedFileView.swift`, `SelectedFilesPanelViewModel.swift`) and unique stale symbols (`PresetBottomBar`, `SelectedFilesContentView`, `SelectedFilesPanelViewModel`, `PresetTwoPanePopover_Copy`, `CopyPresetPreviewView`, `PresetTwoPanePopover_Chat`) are not referenced from app source;
- `App/WindowState.swift` does not reintroduce scoped `searchViewModel` wiring;
- `WorkspaceFilesViewModel.swift` does not reintroduce the removed `loadContentsRecursively` eager-loading seam.

## Historical resolved items

- `MCPControlMessages.swift`, `MCPFilesystemIdentity.swift`, and the `MCPExternalClientEvent` wire DTO now have one source of truth in `Sources/RepoPromptShared/MCP`; the app and CLI targets depend on `RepoPromptShared`.
- The old production dependency on a test-named filesystem seam was renamed to `FileSystemProviding`; test doubles/support live under tests.
- The dead Dart parser fixture under app source was removed rather than retained as production code.
- Workspace, Agent Mode, MCP infrastructure, workspace context/files, Prompt, Context Builder, Chat, Search, Settings, Code Map, and syntax parsing were moved toward the hybrid feature/infrastructure layout.
- Benchmark, debug, and stress harnesses were classified as app-integrated diagnostics or documented wiring exceptions.
- The old top-level layer buckets were pruned as part of Work Item 11.
- The native file-tree visualization, IDE-era search view-model layer, and eager root materialization seams were removed. Textual project structure maps and MCP `get_file_tree` output remain supported compatibility surfaces.
- The Claude-compatible Agent Mode provider family was extracted into the `RepoPromptClaudeCompatibleProvider` package product under `Packages/RepoPromptAgentProviders/`; see `docs/architecture/provider-plugins.md` for the bridge/adapter layout and rules for adding new providers.
- Workflow prompt generation now lives in the provider-neutral catalog under `Sources/RepoPromptShared/Workflows/`; the old provider-specific `ClaudeCodeCommands` surface and duplicated bundled prompt mirror under `AppResources/Services/AI/Prompts/` should not be restored.

## Contributor validation commands

Run the smallest focused validation that covers your change, then broaden as needed:

```bash
make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=Agentry
make dev-swift-build PRODUCT=agentry-mcp
make dev-test FILTER=CodexRuntimeAuthorityTests
make dev-test FILTER=WorkspaceFileContextStoreTests
make dev-test
make guardrails
make doctor
make dev-build
make dev-test
```

Use `make run` only when it is safe to stop any existing Agentry instance and launch the debug app.
