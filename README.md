**A free, open-source native macOS app and agent orchestrator for context engineering.**

Agentry helps coding agents understand your codebase before they act. It
assembles focused, reviewable context from files, CodeMaps, repository
structure, and Git diffs, then hands that context to AI tools and CLI agents.

Agentry also builds an agent harness around its bundled MCP server.
Connect MCP-compatible clients and CLI agents to search repositories, inspect
files, curate context, run agent sessions, and orchestrate work through a shared
native macOS interface.

## Get Started

Choose one of these setup paths. You do not need to open Xcode.

### Install with Homebrew

For the signed and notarized public app, use the dedicated Agentry
Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew tap repoprompt/repoprompt-ce
brew install --cask repoprompt-ce
```

This installs `/Applications/Agentry.app` from the
[`repoprompt/homebrew-repoprompt-ce`](https://github.com/repoprompt/homebrew-repoprompt-ce)
tap. The cask consumes the promoted public updater ZIP from
[`repoprompt/repoprompt-ce-updates`](https://github.com/repoprompt/repoprompt-ce-updates);
it does not build from source. Source-build paths remain below for contributors
and local development.

### Build and launch locally

For development and quick evaluation, double-click
[`Launch Agentry.command`](Launch%20Agentry.command) in Finder.

The launcher requires Python 3, builds Agentry through the coordinated
developer daemon, opens the debug app, and keeps a small terminal window
available for rebuild, status, and stop controls. It does not provide an
uncoordinated no-Python fallback because lifecycle actions validate the exact
debug executable path. It preserves an explicit compatible `DEVELOPER_DIR`, or
selects an installed full Xcode for the launcher process without changing the
system-wide `xcode-select` setting.

The debug launcher uses an available `Apple Development:` signing identity. If
your Mac does not have one, run the same debug app from Terminal with explicit
ad-hoc signing:

```bash
ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1 ./conductor app relaunch
```

Ad-hoc debug builds use in-memory secure storage, so saved API keys and secure
permission changes do not persist across launches. For persistent debug
Keychain storage, pass a stable Apple Development identity explicitly:

```bash
SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./conductor app relaunch
```

For a stable locally signed app under `/Applications`, use the local production
installer below. Its self-signed identity is separate from the debug launcher's
Apple Development signing path.

> **Note:** If you use the debug app to modify Agentry itself, validation
> flows that launch the app or run live smoke checks may rebuild and relaunch it.
> Expect the debug app to restart while those checks run.

| Key | Action                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `r` | Rebuild and relaunch                        |
| `s` | Show app status                             |
| `x` | Stop the app                                |
| `q` | Close the launcher without stopping the app |

### Install a local production build

For a release-mode app under `/Applications`, install Python 3 and double-click
[`Install Agentry Local Production.command`](Install%20Agentry%20Local%20Production.command)
in Finder. The Finder launcher uses the coordinated developer daemon.

The installer builds Agentry from source and replaces any existing
`/Applications/Agentry.app` using a dedicated self-signed certificate
trusted only on your Mac. macOS may ask you to approve the certificate.
It requires a full Xcode installation and selects a compatible installed Xcode
for the installer process without changing your system-wide `xcode-select`
setting.

The resulting app is local-only. It is not notarized and should not be copied to
another Mac or redistributed.

### Source-build requirements

- macOS 26 or later
- Xcode 26, or matching Command Line Tools with the macOS 26 SDK. The Finder
  debug launcher and local production installer require the full Xcode app.

### Develop in Xcode

Generate and open the disposable contributor workspace with:

```bash
make xcode
```

In Xcode 26.3, use `Agentry App` for the packaged debug app,
`Agentry MCP` for the coordinated MCP executable, and `Agentry
Tests` for tests. The test scheme delegates to conductor because
`RepoPromptMCP` is an executable-only SwiftPM target. Xcode also exposes the
native `Agentry` and `agentry-mcp` product schemes.

See [`docs/architecture/xcode-workspace.md`](docs/architecture/xcode-workspace.md)
for generation, validation, cleanup, and workflow boundaries. Release packaging
is unchanged and does not use the generated workspace.

## Features

- **Context engineering**: Build dense, reviewable prompts with the files and
  repository details an AI model actually needs.
- **Codebase orientation**: Combine file trees, selected file contents, line
  slices, CodeMaps, and Git diffs.
- **Context Builder**: Let an agent explore the repository, identify relevant
  files, and curate context within a token budget. Long-running MCP calls expose
  [request-scoped progress](docs/mcp-progress.md) when the client supplies a
  progress token.
- **Context Composer**: Review selected files and codemaps, configure prompt packaging and Git context, and copy a fresh model-ready prompt without leaving Agent Mode.
- **Agent orchestration**: Run and coordinate CLI-backed coding agents from the
  native macOS app. See [`docs/worktrees.md`](docs/worktrees.md) for app-managed
  worktrees and `.worktreeinclude` local file copying.
- **MCP server and CLI integration**: Connect external MCP-compatible tools and
  CLI agents to Agentry's repository context and agent harness.
- **Multi-root workspaces**: Work across related repositories, packages, and
  documentation folders in one workspace.
- **Reviewable handoffs**: Inspect and refine selected context before sending it
  to another model or agent.

## About Agentry

Agentry is a free, open-source native macOS workspace for context engineering,
agent orchestration, and local development. Its application identity, storage,
update feeds, and release history are independent.

Maintainers track release signing, Sparkle metadata, dependency pins, and
third-party notices in
[`docs/open-source-readiness.md`](docs/open-source-readiness.md).

## In Tribute to RepoPrompt / 致敬 RepoPrompt

Agentry is a community-driven fork and secondary development based on the
open-source [RepoPrompt project](https://github.com/repoprompt/repoprompt-ce).
It builds on the
upstream project's open-source foundation and carries forward its founding
idea: give coding agents the right context before they act.

We gratefully acknowledge the RepoPrompt maintainers and contributors whose
architecture, code, and context-engineering vision make this work possible.
Agentry extends and adapts that foundation for its own experiments, features,
and release cadence while preserving the upstream attribution and
Apache-2.0 license.

Agentry is an independent project, not an official RepoPrompt distribution and
not affiliated with or endorsed by the RepoPrompt maintainers.
