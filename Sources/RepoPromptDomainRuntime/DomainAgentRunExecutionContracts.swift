// MARK: - Neutral Agent run execution contracts

//
// These types define the provider-neutral, presentation-free command and result
// vocabulary shared by every Agent run execution host (the app-hosted Agent Mode
// runtime and the direct/headless composition). They intentionally carry no
// session, tab, transcript, or UI state: canonical durable lifecycle remains
// owned by `DomainAgentSessionAuthority`, and hosts adapt these values into their
// own projection layers.

/// Why an Agent run is being cancelled.
///
/// This is a command-side contract: hosts translate user or lifecycle actions
/// into one of these intents before asking their execution layer to stop a run.
package enum DomainAgentRunCancellationIntent: Equatable, Hashable {
    /// The user explicitly stopped the run.
    case userStop
    /// The run is being stopped because its execution location (worktree/cwd)
    /// is changing; queued undelivered work should be restored, not replayed.
    case executionLocationChange
    /// The hosting runtime is shutting down (window close, app termination).
    case runtimeShutdown

    /// resources (for example active MCP tool executions) for this intent.

/// What terminal settlement should do with attachment files reserved for a turn.
///
/// This is provider-neutral command vocabulary, not attachment lifecycle
/// authority: the execution host applies the disposition through its attachment
/// persistence boundary. It carries no files, session state, or presentation
/// policy, and does not change the canonical run lifecycle authority owned by
/// `DomainAgentSessionAuthority`.
