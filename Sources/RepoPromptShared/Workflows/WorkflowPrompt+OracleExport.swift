# ChatGPT Prompt Export\(suffix)

Raw request: $ARGUMENTS

Your job: select the right files and export a prompt file that another model can act on directly.

**Before you do anything else**, extract the real task from the raw request above. Users often phrase this as "export a prompt for X" or "write a prompt about Y" — strip away any meta-framing about exporting/prompting and identify the underlying problem. For example:
- "export a prompt to evaluate the auth refresh logic" → the task is "evaluate the auth refresh logic"
- "write a ChatGPT prompt about the token caching bug" → the task is "investigate the token caching bug"
- "review the last 3 commits" → the task is already clean

Use the extracted task (not the raw request) for all downstream steps — intent classification, `context_builder` instructions, and the final exported prompt.

## Rules

- Infer **Question / Plan / Review** when obvious. Ask only if unclear.
- For vague requests, use repo evidence before asking questions.
- Use the fast path only when the scope is already small, concrete, and obviously file-local.
- For broad **Question/Plan** exports, `context_builder` is the default path.
- For review exports, `context_builder` is the default path.
- Do **not** spend exploratory tool calls proving that a broad request is complex enough for `context_builder`.
- When you do use `context_builder` here, keep `response_type: "clarify"`.
- If you used the fast path, review the selection and prompt text before exporting.
- If you used `context_builder`, trust its curated selection, budget, and generated prompt by default; only re-check or adjust prompt/selection/tokens if you noticed a concrete issue.
- Export to a unique repo-local file, usually in `prompt-exports/`.
- Derive a short slug from the user's request and use it in the filename.
- Use a relative repo-local path by default; do not use an absolute path or another folder unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Workflow
\(workspaceVerificationBlock(variant: variant, heading: "### 0", beforeAction: "building context", nextStep: "Step 1"))
### 1. Determine intent and scope

Infer the prompt type from the request:
- **Review** for git diff / PR / branch comparison requests — i.e. the user wants to inspect *changes*
- **Plan** for design / approach / implementation-plan / architectural audit / code evaluation requests — even if the user says "review" or "audit", if there are no diffs involved, this is a Plan
- **Question** only when the user is asking a specific, bounded question with a clear answer
- **When in doubt, default to Plan.** Generic or open-ended requests ("look into X", "help me with Y", "figure out Z") produce better results with the Plan preset, which gives the receiving model structured guidance.

If the request is vague:
- for **Review**: inspect git state first
- for **Question/Plan**: if it sounds broad, architectural, evaluative, redesign-oriented, or likely multi-file, skip manual exploration and go straight to `context_builder`

Ask **one specific question** only if needed, and base it on the repo state you found.
Good question shapes:
- “I see changes in A and B. Do you want review of these current uncommitted changes, or against `main`?”
- “I found likely touchpoints in X and Y. Is the fix plan for X only, or this broader flow?”

\(isAgent ? """
If clarification is needed, use `ask_user`:

```json
{"tool":"ask_user","args":{
  "question":"I found likely scope in <A> and <B>. Which one should the exported prompt focus on?",
  "options":["Focus on A","Focus on B","Cover both"],
  "context":"I want the export scope to match the code I found instead of guessing.",
  "timeout_seconds":90
}}
```
""" : "")
**If the scope is still unclear, STOP and ask the user.** Do not ask generic workflow questions when you could ask a concrete scope question instead.

### 2. Choose context path

\(budgetGuidanceLine)

#### Review

Start by checking git state:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"git","args":{"op":"status"}}
{"tool":"git","args":{"op":"diff","detail":"files"}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'git status'
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'git diff --detail files'
```
"""))

\(reviewScopeConfirmationBlock(variant: variant, heading: "#### Review Scope Confirmation"))

\(reviewBudgetRule)
\(reviewFastPathLine)
\(reviewDeepPathLine)
For review exports, explicitly reference the diff / changed files in the context you build.

**Always include the phrase "code review" in your `context_builder` instructions for Review exports.** This phrase activates diff analysis in the Context Builder agent. Without it, the builder treats the request as a general exploration.

#### Question / Plan

Default to `context_builder` for any request that is broad, architectural, evaluative, redesign-oriented, or likely to touch multiple files.

Do **not** spend tool calls proving that these requests are complex. If the user is asking you to evaluate logic, assess a design, rethink a flow, or reason about behavior across a system, call `context_builder` immediately.

Use the fast path only when the request is already small and obvious:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"file_search","args":{"pattern":"<key term>","mode":"both"}}
```

```json
{"tool":"manage_selection","args":{"op":"add","paths":["RootName/path/to/FileA.swift","RootName/path/to/FileB.swift"]}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'search "<key term>"'
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'select add RootName/path/to/FileA.swift RootName/path/to/FileB.swift'
```
"""))

If there is any real doubt that the fast path will fully cover the task, use `context_builder`.

Otherwise use `context_builder`:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"context_builder","args":{
  "instructions":"<task>The actual problem to solve — not about exporting or prompting</task>\\n<context>Scope: <what you found>.</context>",
  "response_type":"clarify"
}}
```

```json
{"tool":"context_builder","args":{
	"instructions":"<task>Code review of changes against <confirmed_scope>.</task>\\n<context>Intent: code review. Branch: <branch_name>.</context>",
  "response_type":"clarify"
}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'builder "<task>The actual problem to solve — not about exporting or prompting</task>
<context>Scope: <what you found>.</context>" --response-type clarify'

agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'builder "<task>Code review of changes against <confirmed_scope>.</task>
<context>Intent: code review. Branch: <branch_name>.</context>" --response-type clarify'
```
"""))

### 3. Final check (fast path only — skip after `context_builder`)

**If you used `context_builder`, skip this step entirely and go straight to Step 4.** The builder already curated the selection, managed the token budget, and wrote the prompt. Do not read the prompt back, do not inspect the selection, do not check token counts, and do not critique, rewrite, or "improve" the generated prompt text. Treat the builder's output as the final payload for export.

**If you used the fast path**, check the selection and prompt text before exporting:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"manage_selection","args":{"op":"get","view":"summary"}}
```

```json
{"tool":"prompt","args":{"op":"get"}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'select get'
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'prompt get'
```
"""))

If available in this surface, the fast path may also inspect token state:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"workspace_context","args":{"include":["selection","tokens"]}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'context --include selection,tokens'
```
"""))

If the prompt wording or selection is off, fix it before exporting.

### 4. Export

Use a unique repo-local relative path such as:
- `prompt-exports/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<hhmmss>-question-<slug-from-request>.md`
- `prompt-exports/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<hhmmss>-plan-<slug-from-request>.md`
- `prompt-exports/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<hhmmss>-review-<slug-from-request>.md`

Choose `<slug-from-request>` by summarizing the user's request into a short filesystem-safe phrase. Prefer descriptive slugs like `collapsing-tool-logic` or `agent-transcript-redesign`, not generic names like `export` or `question`.

Unless the user explicitly asks for another destination, keep the export path relative and repo-local under `prompt-exports/`.

Preset mapping:
- `Question` → `standard` (only for specific, bounded questions)
- `Plan` → `plan` (default for generic, open-ended, or ambiguous requests)
- `Review` → `codeReview`

\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"prompt","args":{"op":"export","path":"prompt-exports/<unique filename>.md","copy_preset":"<standard|plan|codeReview>"}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'prompt export "prompt-exports/<unique filename>.md" --copy-preset <standard|plan|codeReview>'
```
"""))

## Anti-patterns

- Asking generic workflow questions before checking repo state
- Skipping `context_builder` for branch / PR / large review exports
- Doing exploratory searches or file reads before `context_builder` for a broad Question/Plan export just to prove the task is complex
- Treating requests like "evaluate this logic", "assess this design", or "rethink this flow" as fast-path exports
- Using the fast path when scope is still vague
- Exporting from the fast path without checking the selection and prompt text
- Re-checking selection, prompt text, or tokens after `context_builder` — the builder already finalized the payload
- Reading the prompt back after `context_builder` to review, critique, rewrite, or "improve" it — export it as-is
- Calling `prompt get`, `manage_selection get`, or `workspace_context` after `context_builder` completed — go straight to export
- Reusing generic filenames like `oracle-prompt.md` by default
- Using generic slugs like `export`, `question`, or `plan` when the request gives you enough detail for a better filename
- Writing to an absolute path or outside the repo by default when the user did not ask for that
- Passing export/prompt meta-framing to `context_builder` — instructions like "export a prompt for X" or "build context for a ChatGPT prompt about Y" cause the builder to write a prompt *about prompting* instead of a prompt that solves X. Always pass the extracted task directly.

Report the final export path, prompt type, whether you used the fast path or `context_builder`, and token count if available.
