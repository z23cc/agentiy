## Protocol
\(isAgent ? "" : "\n0. **Verify workspace** – Confirm the target codebase is loaded\(variant == .cli ? " and identify the correct window" : "").")
1. **Survey changes** – Check git state and recent commits to understand what's changed.
2. **Determine scope** – Infer the comparison scope from the user's request. Only ask for clarification if the scope is ambiguous or unspecified.
3. **Deep review** – Run \(builderName) with `response_type: "review"`, explicitly specifying the confirmed comparison scope.
4. **Fill gaps** – If the review missed areas, run focused follow-up reviews explicitly describing what was/wasn't covered.

```
"""))

\(reviewScopeConfirmationBlock(variant: variant))

## Step 3: Deep Review (via \(builderName) - REQUIRED)

⚠️ Don't skip this step. Call \(builderName) with `response_type: "review"` for proper code review context.

Include the confirmed comparison scope in your instructions so the context builder knows exactly what to review.

Use XML tags to structure the instructions:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"context_builder","args":{
  "instructions":"<task>Review changes comparing <current_branch> against <confirmed_comparison_target>. Focus on correctness, security, API changes, error handling.</task>\n\n<context>Comparison: <confirmed_scope> (e.g., 'uncommitted', 'main', 'staged')\nCurrent branch: <branch_name>\nChanged files: <list key files from git diff></context>\n\n<discovery_agent-guidelines>Focus on the directories containing changes.</discovery_agent-guidelines>",
  "response_type":"review"
}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'builder "<task>Review changes comparing <current_branch> against <confirmed_comparison_target>. Focus on correctness, security, API changes, error handling.</task>

<context>Comparison: <confirmed_scope> (e.g., uncommitted, main, staged)
Current branch: <branch_name>
Changed files: <list key files></context>

<discovery_agent-guidelines>Focus on directories containing changes.</discovery_agent-guidelines>" --response-type review'
```
"""))
\(variant == .cli ? "\n**Tab routing:** The builder response returns a `tab_id` — pass `-t <tab_id>` in follow-up `chat` invocations to continue the same conversation.\n" : "")
## Optional: Clarify Findings

After receiving review findings, you can ask clarifying questions in the same chat:
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"\(chatToolName)","args":{
  "chat_id":"<from context_builder>",
  "message":"Can you explain the security concern in more detail? What's the attack vector?",
  "mode":"chat",
  "new_chat":false
}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -t '<tab_id>' -e 'chat "Can you explain the security concern in more detail? What'\\''s the attack vector?" --mode chat'
```

> Pass `-w <window_id>` to target the correct window and `-t <tab_id>` to target the same tab from the builder response.
"""))

## Step 4: Fill Gaps

If the review omitted significant areas, run a focused follow-up. **Explicitly describe** what was already covered and what needs review now (\(builderName) has no memory of previous runs):
\(example(variant,
	mcp: """
```json
{"tool":"context_builder","args":{
  "instructions":"<task>Review <specific area> in depth.</task>\n\n<context>Previous review covered: <list files/areas reviewed>.\nNot yet reviewed: <list files/areas to review now>.</context>\n\n<discovery_agent-guidelines>Focus specifically on <directories/files not yet covered>.</discovery_agent-guidelines>",
  "response_type":"review"
}}
```
""",
	cli: """
```bash
agentry-cli -w <window_id> -e 'builder "<task>Review <specific area> in depth.</task>

<context>Previous review covered: <list files/areas reviewed>.
Not yet reviewed: <list files/areas to review now>.</context>

<discovery_agent-guidelines>Focus specifically on <directories/files not yet covered>.</discovery_agent-guidelines>" --response-type review'
```
"""))

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- 🚫 Proceeding with an ambiguous scope – if the user didn't specify a comparison target and it's unclear from context, you must ask before calling \(builderName)
- 🚫 Skipping \(builderName) and attempting to review by reading files manually – you'll miss architectural context
- 🚫 Calling \(builderName) without specifying the confirmed comparison scope in the instructions
- 🚫 Doing extensive file reading before calling \(builderName) – git status/log/diff is sufficient for Step 1
- 🚫 Providing review feedback without first calling \(builderName) with `response_type: "review"`
- 🚫 Assuming the git diff alone is sufficient context for a thorough review
- 🚫 Reading changed files manually instead of letting \(builderName) build proper review context\(variant == .cli ? "\n- 🚫 **CLI:** Forgetting to pass `-w <window_id>` – CLI invocations are stateless and require explicit window targeting" : "")

Determine the comparison scope from the user's request and git state.

**If the scope is ambiguous or not specified**, ask the user to clarify:

- **Comparison target**: What should changes be compared against?
  - `uncommitted` – All uncommitted changes vs HEAD (default)
  - `staged` – Only staged changes vs HEAD
  - `back:N` – Last N commits
  - `main` or `master` – Compare current branch against trunk
