// SEARCH-HELPER: FileHandleChunkChannel, AsyncStream, chunk ordering, readabilityHandler, backpressure
/// Provides an ordered, single-consumer async stream of `Data` chunks from a `FileHandle`.
///
/// The `readabilityHandler` on `FileHandle` fires on an arbitrary dispatch queue. Wrapping
/// each callback in a standalone `Task` can reorder chunks because actor task scheduling is
/// not guaranteed FIFO. This channel instead feeds chunks into an `AsyncStream.Continuation`
/// protected by `os_unfair_lock`, preserving the order in which the OS delivers data.
///
/// A single consumer task iterates `stream` to process chunks in the exact order they arrived.
///
/// Covered by `RepoPromptTests/Process/ProcessCoreTests.swift`.
